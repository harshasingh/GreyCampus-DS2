(In your\\nclarinet posting you edited out some stuff; was it the following???)\\nFriday\\'s New York Times reported that this group definitely is\\nmore conservative than even Sheikh Baz and his followers (who\\nthink that the House of Saud does not rule the country conservatively\\nenough).  The NYT reported that, besides complaining that the\\ngovernment was not conservative enough, they have:\\n\\n\\t- asserted that the (approx. 500,000) Shiites in the Kingdom\\n\\t  are apostates, a charge that under Saudi (and Islamic) law\\n\\t  brings the death penalty.  \\n\\n\\t  Diplomatic guy (Sheikh bin Jibrin), isn\\'t he Ilyess?\\n\\n\\t- called for severe punishment of the 40 or so women who\\n\\t  drove in public a while back to protest the ban on\\n\\t  women driving.  The guy from the group who said this,\\n\\t  Abdelhamoud al-Toweijri, said that these women should\\n\\t  be fired from their jobs, jailed, and branded as\\n\\t  prostitutes.\\n\\n\\t  Is this what you want to see happen, Ilyess?  I\\'ve\\n\\t  heard many Muslims say that the ban on women driving\\n\\t  has no basis in the Qur\\'an, the ahadith, etc.\\n\\t  Yet these folks not only like the ban, they want\\n\\t  these women falsely called prostitutes?  \\n\\n\\t  If I were you, I\\'d choose my heroes wisely,\\n\\t  Ilyess, not just reflexively rally behind\\n\\t  anyone who hates anyone you hate.\\n\\n\\t- say that women should not be allowed to work.\\n\\n\\t- say that TV and radio are too immoral in the Kingdom.\\n\\nNow, the House of Saud is neither my least nor my most favorite government\\non earth; I think they restrict religious and political reedom a lot, among\\nother things.  I just think that the most likely replacements\\nfor them are going to be a lot worse for the citizens of the country.\\nBut I think the House of Saud is feeling the heat lately.  In the\\nlast six months or so I\\'ve read there have been stepped up harassing\\nby the muttawain (religious police---*not* government) of Western women\\nnot fully veiled (something stupid for women to do, IMO, because it\\nsends the wrong signals about your morality).  And I\\'ve read that\\nthey\\'ve cracked down on the few, home-based expartiate religious\\ngatherings, and even posted rewards in (government-owned) newspapers\\noffering money for anyone who turns in a group of expartiates who\\ndare worship in their homes or any other secret place. So the\\ngovernment has grown even more intolerant to try to take some of\\nthe wind out of the sails of the more-conservative opposition.\\nAs unislamic as some of these things are, they\\'re just a small\\ntaste of what would happen if these guys overthrow the House of\\nSaud, like they\\'re trying to in the long run.\\n\\nIs this really what you (and Rached and others in the general\\nwest-is-evil-zionists-rule-hate-west-or-you-are-a-puppet crowd)\\nwant, Ilyess?\\n\\n--\\nDave Bakken\\n==>\"the President is doing a fine job, but the problem is we don\\'t know what\\n    to do with her husband.\" James Carville (Clinton campaign strategist),2/93\\n==>\"Oh, please call Daddy.

The risk of endogenous infection is clearly ever present.  \\nIndeed, candidiasis occurs worldwide and is the most common systemic \\nmycosis.\"  Neutrophils play the main role in preventing a systemic \\ninfection(candidiasis) so you would have to have a low neutrophil count or \\n\"sick\" neutrophils to see a systemic infection.  Poor diet and persistent \\nparasitic infestation set many third world residents up for candidiasis.\\nYour assessment of candidiasis in the U.S. is correct and I do not dispute \\nit.\\n\\nWhat I posted was a discussion of candida blooms, without systemic \\ninfection.  These blooms would be responsible for local sites of irritation\\n(GI tract, mouth, vagina and sinus cavity).  Knocking down the bacterial \\ncompetition for candida was proposed as a possible trigger for candida \\nblooms.  Let me quote from Zinsser\\'s again: \"However, some factors, such as \\nthe use of a broad-spectrum antibacterial antibiotic, may predispose to \\nboth mucosal and systemic infections\".  I was addressing mucosal infections\\n(I like the term blooms better).  The nutrition course that I teach covers \\nthis effect of antibiotic treatment as well as the \"cure\".  I guess that \\nyour nutrition course does not, too bad.  \\n\\n\\n>>Here is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly \\n>>called, are not truely caused by yeasts.  The most common organism responsible\\n>>for this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a \\n>>yeast-like fungus.  \\n> \\n> Well, maybe I\\'m getting picky, but I always thought that a yeast\\n> was one form that a fungus could exist in, the other being the\\n> mold form.

If you \\nnoticed my faculty rank, I\\'m a biochemist, not a microbiologist.\\nCandida is classifed as a fungus(according to Zinsser\\'s).  But, as you point \\nout, it displays dimorphism.  It is capable of producing yeast cells, \\npseudohyphae and true hyphae.  Elisabeth, you are probably a microbiologist \\nand that makes a lot of sense to you.  To a biochemist, it\\'s a lot of \\nGreek.  So I called it a yeast-like fungus, go ahead and crucify me.\\n\\nYou know Elisabeth, I still haven\\'t been able to figure out why such a small \\nlittle organism like Candida can bring out so much hostility in people in \\nSci. Med.  And I must admitt that I got sucked into the mud slinging too.\\nI keep hoping that if people will just take the time to think about what \\nI\\'ve said, that it will make sense.

As you will see, the journal is structured\\nin the following way: the editorial (first page); profiles (second page\\n-- biography of an editor, in this issue, Terry Winograd); the edited\\npart of papers (pp. 3-80); mission and research reports (A plan for\\nknowledge archives project in Japan and CSLI in Stanford, pp. 81-100);\\nand news and announcements (pp. 101-108). This structure is mentioned to\\ngive you a suggestion how could you help to make the contents of the\\njournal significant, diverse, and interesting, bringing your own views\\ninto the discourse.\\n   A great emphasis is given to the so-called editorial page. This page\\nexpresses an opinion (belief) of the writing editor to some problems\\nwithin the scope of computing and informatics, extending into other\\nconcerning disciplines, e.g. cybernetics, advanced AI, cognitive sciences,\\nmind, informationally concerned neural sciences, advanced technology \\n(e.g. photonics), etc. I asked professor Terry Winograd to write this\\npage for Number 2. I certainly would appreciate very much to get\\nsuggestions or possible offers from other editors, who like to express\\ntheir strong (directed) beliefs concerning a future development of the\\narea in question.\\n   On the second page of each Number an editor\\'s profile is published.\\nThe aim of the profile is twofold: to show his/her professional \\nachievements, interests, scientific, and philosophical orientation on\\none side; to narrate his/her life story in the environments in which\\neditors has lived and live on the other side.

Islam \\n>is a religion and it is practised in many parts of the world. But it is not\\n>, yes definitely not, an ethinic group. ok! so, these Bosnian Muslims, who\\n>are they? to which ethnic group do they belong? what language(s) do they\\n>speak? do they have a different language from that of the Serbs or Croats? \\n\\nIn Bosnia, \"Muslim\" is not merely a religious category, but an ethnic\\none as well.  Actually, here are the two contradictory arguments\\nmade by people on this subject:\\n\\n(1) There is only Serbian and Croatian nationality, and Bosnian Muslims\\n    are simply Croats and Serbs of Islamic faith.\\n\\n(2) Bosnian Muslims are a separate nationality since they do not feel\\n    themselves to be Croats nor Serbs.\\n\\nIn 1968, argument (2) was accepted by former Yugoslavia as valid,\\nand (1) was soundly rejected.  The reasons are pragmatic: even if\\nBosnian Muslims are Croats and Serbs who converted to Islam under\\nTurkish rule centuries ago, none of the present generation has any\\nclue what was their ancestor\\'s actual nationality.  In fact, although\\nBosnian Muslims have felt drawn to Croatian or Serbian national\\nallegiance, most of them feel they have a separate cultural and\\nhistoric identity.  So, arguments like \"yes, but your ancestors were\\nCroats or Serbs\" carry very little weight.  Regardless of what\\ntheir ancestors might have been, as long as Bosnian Muslims feel\\nthat they are a separate national group, that ends the debate.\\nWhat outsiders say is simply not relevant.\\n\\n>the way the western press use the word \\'muslim\\' in this Bosnian debacle has \\n>kept me wondering when the meaning of muslim/moslem i knew from childhood was \\n>changed in the dictionary. this is just a question. no flames intended!\\n\\nIn the case of former Yugoslavia, the date is 1971, when \"Muslim nationality\"\\nappeared as a census category for the first time.  This was the result\\nof a sequence of decisions over the past decade, from recognizing\\n\"Bosniaks\" as an ethnic group (1961) to February 1968 resolution (in B-H)\\ndeclaring that Muslims are a separate nation, to formal endorsement \\nof this in January 1969, and eventually to the 1971 inclusion of\\n\"Muslim nationality\" choice in census forms.\\n\\nFor comparison, in 1948 census there were three national categories\\navailable to Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina:\\n\\nSerb-Muslims:                        71,991\\nCroat-Muslims:                       25,295\\nMuslims, ethnically undeclared:     788,403\\n\\nThis clearly demonstrates that Muslims feel themselves to be their own\\nnationality.  Only a tiny minority felt able to choose Serb or Croat\\nnationality.  Census results show that Bosnian Muslims have\\nconsistently opted for a third category: in 1948 they chose \"undeclared\",\\nin 1953 they chose \"Yugoslavs\", in 1961 both \"Yugoslavs\" and \"Bosniak \\nethnic group\", and in 1971, 1981 and 1991 they chose \"Muslim nationality\".\\n\\nPerhaps the term \"Bosnian Muslim nationality\" is too confusing for\\nthe rest of the world.  But, in the present context, we ARE talking\\nabout Muslims as nationality; not as a religous group within some\\nseparate national identity.  The reasons are mostly historical and\\ncultural.  Religion plays a smaller role, as a part of culture in general,\\nbecause the area is simply not known for religious fanaticism.  Political\\nfanaticism, yes; religious fanaticism, no.  Group security and survival\\ndominate people\\'s thinking; not fine points of theology.  In fact,\\nBosnia-Herzegovina is as well known for religious tolerance in peacetime\\nas it is known for terrible carnage in wartime.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n-Josip\\n\\n\\n\\n' => alt.atheism \n",

The car has a 5 speed manual tranmission.\\nSince the car was bought new, while shifting from 2nd to 3rd,  unless \\nI do it SLOWLY and carefully, it makes a \"popping\" or \"hitting\" sound.\\nThe dealer and Mitsubishi customer service (reached by an 800 #) say \\nthis is NORMAL for the car.

The clutch had no effect.\\n   2- The front tires would not budge, even when the clutch is\\n      fully depressed.\\n   3- If the clutch is released the engine would die.\\n   4- Assuming that some gear was engaged while the shifter was\\n      stuck, I could not make the car move.  It acted as if\\n      it were in Neutral(except for dying when clutch is released.)\\n   5- I finally was able to release the shifter by having \\n      someone rock the car back and forth (less than an inch),\\n      while I depressed the clutch and jiggled the shifter.\\n   6- The shifter acted normally after that.\\n\\nWhen this happened, I took it to the dealer, they checked the \\nclutch, it was o.k. They checked the transmission, it was o.k.\\n\\nI had the exact problem a couple of months ago, and again last\\nweek.  The dealer says there is nothing they can do because \\nMitsubishi (the 800 #) says they have never heard of the\\nproblem, and the dealer could not reproduce the problem while\\nthey had the car.  \\nIn all three occurances, the car was parked head first in a garage,\\nand since the front wheels were stuck, the car could not be towed\\nto the dealer before releasing the shifter (hence temporarily\\nsolving the problem).  And the dealer, and Mitsubishi, refused to\\nsend someone to check the car while it was stuck. \\nI KNOW there is smething wrong with the transmission (shifting \\nfrom 2nd to 3rd), and getting stuck at random, but I can\\'t get \\nthe dealer to fix it.

On April 22 and 23, delta Differenced One-way Range (DOR) passes were\\nperformed over DSS-14/63 (Goldstone/Madrid 70 meter antennas) and DSS-14/43\\n(Goldstone/Canberra 70 meter antennas), respectively.  Initial results \\nindicate the delta DOR pass on April 22 was unsuccessful due to ground\\nstation hardware problems but the one on April 23 was successfully performed.\\n\\n2.  On April 23, a cruise science Memory Readout (MRO) was performed for the\\nMagnetometer (MAG) instrument.  Analysis indicates the data was received\\nproperly.\\n\\n3.  On April 23, the spare power relay contacts were commanded closed via the\\nspacecraft stored sequence.  These relays were commanded closed by the CDS\\n(Command Data Subsystem) prior to launch and were again commanded closed to\\npreclude the possibility at Jupiter of the PPS relays/wiring being a\\nsource of internal electrostatic charge (IESD).\\n\\n4.  On April 26, cruise science Memory Readouts (MRO) were performed for the\\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer\\n(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received\\nproperly.\\n\\n5.  During the period from April 26 to April 27, a navigation cycle was\\nperformed.  This navigation cycle provided near-continuous acquisition of\\ntwo-way doppler and ranging data during three consecutive passes of the\\nspacecraft over DSS-63, DSS-14, and DSS-43.\\n\\n6.  On April 26, real-time commands were sent to test slew the Radio Relay\\nAntenna (RRA) in preparation for the mini-sequence slew test on April 28.\\nThe RRA was slewed from approximately 3.5 degrees from stow to approximately\\n20.3 degrees.  Preliminary analysis indicated the antenna slewed to about 18\\ndegrees which was well within the predicted range.  The RRA was commanded back\\nto approximately 15.2 degrees from stow.  Preliminary analysis indicated the\\nantenna reached about 15.8 degrees also well within the predicted range.  The\\nRRA motor temperature was at 1 degree C at the start of the activity and had\\nincreased to 1.6 degrees C at its completion.\\n\\n     After verifying proper RRA slewing, the RRA slew test mini-sequence was\\nuplinked to the spacecraft for execution on April 28.  Upon successful uplink,\\na Delayed Action Command (DAC) was sent which will reposition the stator on\\nMay 4 to its initial pre-test position.  Also, a DAC was sent to turn the\\nTwo-Way Noncoherent (TWNC) on April 28 prior to the start of the RRA slew test\\nmini-sequence.\\n\\n7.  On April 27, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to\\n264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\\n\\n8.  On April 28, the RRA slew test executed nominally.  The spacecraft under\\nstored sequence control performed six RRA slews starting at about 16 degrees\\nfrom stow and going to 53 degrees, back to 25 degrees, then to 51 degrees,\\nback to 22 degrees, then to 48 degrees and then back to 21 degrees.  All of\\nthe slews were well within the predicted range.  The RRA motor temperature was\\nat 2.3 degrees C at the start of the activity and had increased to 4.4\\ndegrees C at its completion.  After completion of the RRA slews, real-time\\ncommands were sent to reconfigure back to the pre-test configuration.\\n\\n9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant change\\n(greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads 17 DN\\n(3.9 volts).  The DC measurement reads 134 DN (15.7 volts).  These\\nmeasurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special\\nanomaly team.\\n\\n10.

The first Galileo-GDS test of the MGDS V18.0 Command System (CMD) took\\nplace April 27, 1993 with DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna).  The test went\\nwell and demonstrated that the new command system interfaced with the new DSN\\n(Deep Space Network) Group 5 Command Processor Assembly (CPA).  The test was\\nsuccessful and the next test for V18.0 CMD is scheduled for May 1, 1993 with\\nDSS-15 (Goldstone 34 meter antenna).\\n\\n2.  The April System Engineers Monthly Report(SEMR)/Ground System Development\\nOffice (GSDO) MMR was conducted Thursday, April 29.   A review of current\\nProject and Institutional (DSN and MOSO) system status was conducted.  On-going\\ncruise development plus the GSDO Phase 1 and 2 delivery schedules, past months\\naccomplishments  and potential problem areas were discussed.  No significant\\nschedule changes or significant problems were reported.\\n\\n\\nTRAJECTORY\\n\\n     As of noon Thursday, April 29, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory\\nstatus was as follows:\\n\\n\\tDistance from Earth         187,745,300 km (1.26 AU)\\n\\tDistance from Sun           296,335,800 km (1.98 AU)\\n\\tHeliocentric Speed          89,100 km per hour\\n\\tDistance from Jupiter       522,015,800 km\\n\\tRound Trip Light Time       20 minutes, 58 seconds\\n\\nSPECIAL TOPIC\\n\\n1.  As of April 29, 1993, a total of 70259 real-time commands have been\\ntransmitted to Galileo since Launch.  Of these, 65150  were initiated in the\\nsequence design process and 5109 initiated in the real-time command process.\\nIn the past week, 74 real time commands were transmitted: 73 were initiated\\nin the sequence design process and one initiated in the real time command\\nprocess.  Major command activities included commands to perform the initial\\nRRA slew test, uplink the RRA slew test mini-sequence, DACs to reposition the\\nstator and turn the TWNC on, reset the command loss timer, and execute the\\nRRA slew test.\\n     ___    _____     ___\\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\\\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\\n    | | | |  __ \\\\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand\\n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and\\n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.\\n' => sci.space \n",

Just a simple question.\\n\\n...with a simple answer!\\n\\n[EE] As far as I know most of the Armenians belong to the Gregorian Orthodox\\n[EE] faith and such was the case in nineteenth century Ottoman Empire. It is\\n[EE] also known that some Armenian communities were converted into Catholicism\\n[EE] and Protestantism by the Western European missionaries in this period. \\n\\nThe vast majority of Armenians in eastern Anatolia were Gregorian or Armenian\\nApostolic. There was, however, a higher percentage of non-Gregorian Armenians \\nin Cilicia, closer to the Mediterranean, in Adana, Marash, Aintab, etc.  \\n\\n[EE] Another known fact is that almost half of the Armenians living in Anatolia\\n[EE] did not speak any Armenian, but used Turkish in their everyday lives.\\n\\nThis is not true. While it was forbidden for Armenians to speak Armenian in\\ncertain areas of Cilician Armenia, most all Armenians spoke Armenian. In fact,\\nTurks who interacted with Armenians also spoke Armenian! For sure, most all\\nArmenians, especially men, also knew Turkish in order to function in larger \\nsociety.\\n\\n[EE] My question is, given so many separations in the Armenian community, what\\n[EE] was the common denominator of the Armenian people that allowed Armenian\\n[EE] nationalism to emerge in the nineteenth century? As I stated, religion\\n[EE] was not uniform (unlike the Greeks) and many Armenians couldn\\'t even speak\\n[EE] Armenian. I would like to know what factors brought the Armenians in the\\n[EE] Ottoman Empire together and led to the formation of an Armenian \\n[EE] consciousness.\\n\\nThe Armenians in Turkey were persecuted because they were Armenian, regardless\\nof the specific branch of Christianity they professed. The resultant Armenian\\nnationalism was in direct reaction to this persecution. Even at the later \\nstages of WWI, and after the genocide, many Armenians who were converted to \\nIslam were also exterminated because they continued as Armenian Moslems. This \\npractice continued well into the 1920s by Ataturk in parallel with the policy \\nof clearing out pockets of steadfast Islamic fundamentalism. Many of these\\nconverted Armenians, ironically, in order to stay alive, were staunch Moslems. \\n\\n[EE] Any information will be appreciated.\\n\\nYou answered your own question!

If players\\' performance was completely random\\nin (Clutch-No Clutch), then you would still expect some players to be\\ngood in the clutch every year and some to be not-so-good every year.\\nWith two years worth of data, you\\'d have 1/4 of the players good each\\nyear, 1/4 bad each year, and 1/2 would have one good and one bad year.\\nWe have 96 players for 5 years (\\'84-\\'88).  Just flipping a coin, you\\'d\\nexpect 3 players to be good all 5 years and 3 to be bad every year.\\nThis is what we actually get--\\n\\nNo. of good years    0    1    2    3    4    5\\nClutch performers    4   10   37   24   18    3\\nCoin flip (random)   3   15   30   30   15    3\\n\\nEssentially the distribution of clutch performers by number of years\\nof good performance is the same as what you would get if the process\\nleading to deviations from non-clutch performance was completely random.\\nIf there was anything to clutch hitting (at least in this definition)\\nthat had any predictive capability, you expect to see the number of\\nplayers at the ends to be much larger than that predicted by flipping\\na coin.  Further, if you limit yourself to players who were a lot above\\nor below average in clutch situations (say, 1 standard deviation from \\nthe mean) more than one year, the random explanation still looks good.\\nIn the four years (\\'84-\\'87) that I looked at the data from Elias, there\\nwere 79 (29) players with a minimum of 25 (50) at bats in clutch \\nsituations that were 1 sigma from the mean two different years.  Of\\nthose 79 (29) players, 38 (14) of them changed sign between the two\\nyears.  In other words, they were great clutch hitters one year and\\nreally horrible the other year.  If it was just a random process, \\nyou\\'d expect those numbers to be 39.5 (14.5).  \\n\\nEverything that\\'s been measured about clutch hitting over a period\\nof years that could be used to predict any ability with any \\nproposed definition has looked like a random process (with the \\ncaveat that there may be something related to platoon advantage\\nthat could be dragged out of the data--e.g., John Lowenstein \\nprobably never had a \"clutch\" AB against a left-handed pitcher,\\nbut he might well have had some in blowouts, so that there would\\nbe a bias since his clutch ABs would be more geared to his \\nplatoon advantage).  This is not a subject that has been glanced\\nat casually.  A lot of people have put a lot of effort into \\nstudying it and every one of them, with the exception of the\\nElias study, has been unable to find anything that would allow\\nyou to predict how someone will do in clutch situations better\\nthan flipping a coin.  (Self-serving plug follows:  some of the\\nflaws in the Elias study are discussed in my paper in the forth-\\ncoming SABR book, _The Perfect Game_, by Taylor Publishing.

Still, it was hard to ignore what    \\nwas happening around them. Each time a tank rammed the poorly-constructed building\\nit shook violently. Cult members dodges falling gypsum wallboard and doors.\\nHundreds of gas canisters hurled in from the armored vehicles were filling\\nthe air with noxious fumes. The flying canisters were more frightening than\\nthe tanks. At least one man was hit in the face. The gas began filling the air,\\ndriven by heavy gusts of wind coming through windows and the holes the tanks\\nmade. Scattered throughout the house, the cult members made no efforts to\\ngather. Then the FBI sent in its biggest weapon -- a massive armored vehicle\\nheaded for a chamber, lined with cinder blocks, where authorities hoped to \\nfind Koresh and Schneider and fire tear gas directly at them.\\n  Here the cult members' story diverges from the government's version. The\\nFBI says cult members set fires in three places. But each of the six cult\\nmembers, in separate discussions with lawyers, consistently gave versions\\nat odds with the FBI's account. They say the tank flattened a barrel of \\npropane, spilling its contents. And as the tank thundered through the house,\\nit tipped over lit lanterns, spitting flames that ignited the propane and\\nother flammables.

What you are effectively doing is implying that if a player plays\\nreally well, he 'stores up' mistakes that can be used at a later time.  Ths\\nis not so.  Roy is the 'villain', as you so succinctly put it, because he\\nallowed a very cheap goal.  If you think Roy outplayed Hextall, perhaps you\\nshould get a tape of the game and watch the first 7-8 minutes of the third\\nperiod.  NHL goaltenders _make_ some great saves.  If they did not, they\\nwould not be in the NHL in the first place.  I do not expect any particular\\ngoalie to be able to make the great saves all of the time, even though they\\nare occasionally required.  However, when it comes to a routine shot like\\nSakic's, especially at such a crucial time in a game, I don't think there \\nare any legitimate excuses. \\n\\n>Hextall, on the other hand, had a lot of lucky bounces \\n>[description of lucky bounces.....]\\n>Hextall wasn't particularly brilliant on those plays ... \\n\\nI am not arguing that Hextall was brilliant.  I am arguing is that a\\nrelatively weak wrist shot from the outside of the circle shold not result \\nin a goal. \\n\\n> ... but it was just the 1 goal. The timing stank, but against\\n>an explosive team like Quebec, they gave them 1 opportunity too many with\\n>a powerplay that was totally unnecessary.\\n\\nIn a one-goal game with less than a minute to go there is no such thing as\\n'just the 1 goal'.  I have not defended Dionne for taking the penalty\\neither...in fact I think it was a boneheaded move.  But it led to _one_ goal\\nonly, and Montreal had a _two_ goal lead.  My main concern is the second \\ngoal.\\n\\n>This most certainly was a team loss... Leclair missed his opportunities,\\n>as did Bellows and Brunet. Dionne took a bad penalty. Damphousse and Lebeau\\n>were *silent*. Carbonneau and Savard were a step behind all night. Roy gave\\n>up the bad goal. Roy, by no means, can be singled out for this loss.\\n\\nWhat you say about the skaters is absolutely true.  But realize that the \\ngame was effectively *won*.  You could watch any hockey game (in fact, you\\ncould watch any sporting event period) and spend hours discussing the 'what\\nif's' w.r.t. missed opportunities.  They are not important when the final\\nresult is decided.  If I get the time soon, I'll watch the game again and\\nemail you a list of lucky Montreal bounces and a list of Quebec offensive\\nscrewups.  Montreal was _leading_ with a minute to go.  The goalie\\nis the last line of defence, and I will grant that extra attention is\\nfocussed on him, sometimes without justification.  But Roy gave up a *lousy*\\ngoal, and a team cannot afford such a goal.\\n\\n>>Roy looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot.\\n\\n>And Hextall didn't on Dionne's goal? Please. \\n\\nWHO CARES?  Of what value is it to justify one lousy play with a totally\\nunrelated lousy play?  I could do a Hextall critique if you'd like.  But if\\nyou're going to assess his performance, keep in mind that he made the key\\nsaves at the key times.\\n\\n>Roy is paid big money because\\n>that is his value compared to other goalies ... and he still is in the top 5\\n\\nFor the record, I did not say that Roy was not one of the top goaltenders in\\nthe league.

They are no better than uninformed fans.\\n                            \\nI assume you are referring to me.  However, I have pointed out that I think\\nthe loss can be blamed on Roy.

If it were\\n   revealed that Indians had a role in it, imagine the blow to the\\n   American psyche.\\n   ...\\n      By 1754, when most of these men and others gathered to creat the\\n   Albany Plan of Union, the first try at confederation, they invited\\n   forty-two members of the Iroquois Grand Council to serve as advisors\\n   on confederate structures.  Benjamin Franklin freely acknowledged\\n   his interest in the Iroquois achievement in a famous speech at\\n   Albany Congress: \"It would be a strange thing...if six nations\\n   of ignorant savages[sic] should be capable of forming such a union\\n   and be able to execute it in such a manner that it has subsisted\\n   for ages and appears indissoluble, and yet that a like union should\\n   be impractical for ten or a dozen English colonies.\"\\n      According to Grinde, Franklin convened meetings of Iroquois chiefs\\n   and congressional delegates in order to \"hammer out a plan that he\\n   acknowedged to be similar to the Iroquois Confederacy.\"\\n\\nGrinde is Professor Donald Grinde,Jr., of the University of California\\nat Riverside whose book _The Iroquois and the Founding Fathers of the\\nAmerican Nation_ addresses this issue.\\n--\\nDoug Graham         dgraham@bnr.ca         My opinions are my own.\\n' => alt.atheism \n",

They\\'re\\ngreat at solving problems once the method has been worked out, but not\\nat working out the method itself.\\n\\nAs a specific example, I like to solve numerical crosswords (not the\\nsimple do-the-sums-and-insert-the-answers type, the hard ones.) To do\\nthese with any efficiency, you need to figure out a variety of tricks.\\nNow, I know that you can program a computer to do these puzzles, but\\nin doing so you have to work out the tricks _yourself_, and program\\nthem into the computer. You can, of course, \\'obfuscate\\' the trick, and\\nwrite the program so that it is uncovered, but as far as I can see,\\nthe trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered. Does\\nthis mean that all the ideas we will ever have are already\\npre-programmed into our brains? This is somewhat unlikely, given that\\nour brains ultimately are encoded in 46 chromosomes worth of genetic\\nmaterial, much of which isn\\'t used.\\n\\nOne way around this is to bring the environment into the equation, but\\n(again, as far as I can see) this still has an air of \\'if you see\\nobject X, then perform action Y,\\' and we don\\'t seem to get anywhere.\\nThe algorithm has to anticipate what it might see, and what\\nconclusions to draw from it\\'s experience.\\n\\nThe other problem with algorithms is their instability. Not many\\nalgorithms survive if you take out a large portion of their code, yet\\npeople survive strokes without going completely haywire (there are\\nside-effects, but patients still seem remarkably stable.) Also,\\nneurons in perfectly healthy people are dying at an alarming rate -\\ncan an algorithm survive if I randomly corrupt various bits of it\\'s\\ncode?\\n\\nThe next problem is the sticky question of \"What is colour?\" (replace\\n\\'colour\\' with the sensation of your choice.) Presumably, the\\nmaterialist viewpoint is that it\\'s the product of some kind of\\nchemical reaction. The usual products of such a reaction are energy +\\ndifferent chemicals. Is colour a mixture of these? If this is so, a\\ncomputer won\\'t see colour, because the chemistry is different. Does an\\nalgorithm that sees colour have a selective advantage over an\\nequivalent that doesn\\'t? It shouldn\\'t, because the outputs of each\\nalgorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstances. So why do\\nwe see colour?\\n\\n\\n>\\n>However, such a view is actually a nonsolution. How should minds be\\n>able to act as observers, feel pain and pleasure and issue\\n>commands any better than the brain? Moreover, how do the interactions\\n>occur?\\n\\nA bit of idle speculation...\\n\\nIf I remember correctly, quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction,\\nwith two processes acting on it. The first process has been called\\n\\'Unitary Evolution\\' (or \\'U\\'), is governed by Schroedinger\\'s equation\\nand is well known. The second process, called various things such as\\n\\'collapse of the wavefunction\\' or \\'state vector reduction\\' (or \\'R\\'),\\nand is more mysterious. It is usually said to occur when a\\n\\'measurement\\' takes place, although nobody seems to know precisely\\nwhen that occurs. When it does occur, the effect of R is to abruptly\\nchange the wavefunction.\\n\\nI envisage R as an interaction between the wavefunction and \\'something\\nelse,\\' which I shall imaginitively call \\'part X.\\' It seems reasonable\\nto assume that _something_ causes R, although that something might be\\nthe wavefunction itself (in which case, part X is simply the\\nwavefunction. Note, though, that we\\'d need more than U to explain R.)\\n\\nAnyway, I\\'m speculating that minds would be in part X. There seems to\\nbe some link between consciousness and R, in that we never see linear\\nsuperpositions of anything, although there are alternative\\nexplainations for this. I\\'ve no idea how a brain is supposed to access\\npart X, but since this is only speculation, that won\\'t matter too\\nmuch :-) My main point is that there might be a place for minds in\\nphysics.\\n\\nI\\'ll go back to my nice padded cell now, if that\\'s OK with you :-)\\n\\n>\\n>\\n>Petri\\n\\n-- \\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nKevin Anthoney                                         kax@cs.nott.ac.uk\\n            Don\\'t believe anything you read in .sig files.\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n' => alt.atheism \n",

Well personally, I have a \\'78.  The blue book is just\\na hair over 3 grand.  I bought it for 2500 and then bought new tires 650\\nfront end rebuild 350, carb rebuild 130.  Then i did the unthinkable\\nand blew the engine (not bronco specific, unmaintained engine with 168,000)\\n2400 more bucks there, now it is in nice condition, well after new seats out\\nof a t-bird, radio, 2 amps, speakers, alarm, well the radio and amps were \\nfree and i bought the speakers used for 40 bucks, and the other speakers\\ni took out of my old jeep (Sell a Jeep for a bronco you might ask,\\nbut it was a Wagoneer).  Its a lovely specimen, solid front and rear\\naxels, ford 9\" and a dana 44 up front.  Watch the rear axel wrap, i \\nbusted off my u-bolts ONCE, i added traction shocks after that and \\nhaven\\'t had a problem since.  Also the bottom of the doors tend to \\nrot, bottom of the tailgates likes to rust right up to the new ones\\nthat might be in your budget.  The post 80 broncos have that sickly\\nTTB front end and little stamped and folded steel radius arms were\\nas the 78-79 have nice big cast iron longer radius arms(ie more prspective\\nwheel travel).  The only rust i have is on my doors and a few\\ndings in the sheet metal.  I don\\'t know when the removeable tops were\\ndiscontinued but they are fun.  I just ordered a full convertable top\\nfor 400$ for mine(credit card).  Don\\'t ever break the window if you\\nhave the double laminated bronzed privacy glass in your cap it is over\\n400 bucks to replace.

Faced with situations in which the wrong has\\nalready been done and the damage to the victim has already taken place\\nand cannot be reversed or undone, courts will try to set an equitable\\nprice tag on the loss suffered by the victim and require the wrongdoer\\nto pay this price (rather than an inflated price which the victim might\\nprefer).  In these cases, the \"sale\" has already taken place and is\\nirreversible, and the court simply tries to ensure that a fair price is\\npaid, under the doctrines that (a) only in certain circumstances should\\neven a civil wrongdoer be forced to pay punitive or excessive prices and\\n(b) even a genuine victim should not profit in an unjustified or\\ninequitable manner from his victimhood.  Both of these doctrines may be\\nworth discussing or debating elsewhere, but neither is relevant to cases\\nlike _Boomer_ in which the wrongful act and the loss stemming from it\\nare still in the future and _can_ be reversed/undone (i.e., prevented\\nfrom happening at all) by order of the court.\\n\\nIn these types of cases, all the court has to do is require that the\\npotential victim\\'s property rights are protected until and unless he\\nagrees to sell them at a mutually-acceptable price.  There is no need\\nfor the court to guess at the equitable value of the loss and force both\\nsides to accept its finding.  It can leave that operation up to the\\nparties themselves.\\n\\n>> And again I ask: Since when are the courts supposed to be in the\\n>> business of ensuring that \"unnecessary\" settlement costs are avoided?\\n>> (If so, I\\'ve been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts were\\n>> supposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.)\\n>\\n> Unnecessary settlement costs are unjust because they are punitive.\\n\\nIn cases like _Boomer_, they\\'re simply a cost of doing business.  The\\nfact that the proprietors of the Atlantic Cement Co. got themselves into\\na position in which they found themselves over this barrel is simply a\\nresult of their own poor business decision to start up a cement plant\\nwithout _first_ trying to negotiate with Boomer and everyone else whose\\nproperty rights they\\'d be violating via the operation of their plant.\\nThere\\'s nothing punitive or unjust about it.\\n\\n>> (2) It is \"completely sensible\" only if you believe that the alleged\\n>> right of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoid\\n>> losing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, and\\n>> the alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees to\\n>> not have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people who\\n>> own property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement\\'s wrongful acts.\\n>> [wdstarr]\\n>\\n> Anybody who ever commits a wrongful act should disgorge their entire\\n> set of possessions to wronged person?

(What Microsoft means by \"Device Independent\" is unclear to\\n    me.) Four pixel resolutions are supported: 1 bit, 4 bit, 8 bit, and 24 bit\\n    pixels.\\n\\n    These images were intended for use on DOS (IBM, or Little-Endian) systems.\\n    If\\tyou  are  creating them on another architecture you will have to byte-\\n    swap all short and long integer values.\\n\\n    By convention, DIB images end in the extension \".BMP\".   This  is  because\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t      March 15, 1991\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t    - 2 -\\n\\n\\n    they  are  a  super-set of earlier \"bitmap image files\".  Consequently you\\n    will sometimes hear DIB files referred to as \"BMP\" files.\\n\\n    Since DIB images files are a super-set, there are three \"flavors\"  of  DIB\\n    images:\\n\\t o   DOS DIB images.  These are the recommended\\t convention,  and  the\\n\\t     form  which I will describe how to create.\\t They are intended for\\n\\t     applications running under MS Windows /3.0 in a DOS environment.\\n\\t o   OS/2 DIB images.  My understanding is that these are  the\\tflavor\\n\\t     of DIB images that were used by the Presentation Manager.\\n\\t o   Old-style Bitmap images.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t      March 15, 1991\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t    - 3 -\\n\\n\\n    DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FLAVORS\\n\\n    The DOS DIB images consist of:\\n\\t 1.  A \"BITMAPFILEHEADER\" file header which identifies the file\\t as  a\\n\\t     DIB  file.\\t  This\\theader\\talso gives the total size of the image\\n\\t     file, and the offset to the image data.\\n\\t 2.  A \"BITMAPINFOHEADER\"  image  header  which\\t specifies  the\\t image\\n\\t     attributes.\\n\\t 3.  An optional palette of colors used by the image.  If  it  exists,\\n\\t     this  may contain 2, 16, or 256 entries.  Each entry is a Windows\\n\\t     RGBQUAD structure.\\n\\t 4.  The image data itself.\\n\\n\\n    The OS/2 DIB images consist of:\\n\\t 1.  The same \"BITMAPFILEHEADER\" file header which identifies the file\\n\\t     as\\t a  DIB\\t file.\\t This  header also gives the total size of the\\n\\t     image file, and the offset to the image data.\\n\\t 2.  A \"BITMAPCOREHEADER\"  image  header  which\\t specifies  the\\t image\\n\\t     attributes.\\n\\t 3.  An optional palette of colors used by the image.  Again, if  this\\n\\t     exists  it\\t may  contain  2, 16, or 256 entries.  Each entry is a\\n\\t     Windows RGBTRIPLE structure.\\n\\t 4.  The image data itself.\\n\\n\\n    The Old Style image bitmap consists of:\\n\\t 1.  Either a BITMAPINFOHEADER or a  BITMAPCOREHEADER.\\t Which\\theader\\n\\t     type is determined by the first long integer (DWORD) value.\\n\\t 2.  An optional color palette.\\t  This\\tpalette\\t may  be  composed  of\\n\\t     either   Windows\\tRGBQUAD\\t  structures  (if  the\\theader\\twas  a\\n\\t     BITMAPINFOHEADER) or Windows RGBTRIPLE structures (if the\\theader\\n\\t     was a BITMAPCOREHEADER).\\n\\t 3.  The image data itself.\\n\\n\\n    CREATING DIB IMAGE FILES.\\n\\n    Creating a DOS DIB image file consists of several straight forward\\tsteps.\\n    The headers need to be created and then written to the file.  These header\\n    structures are defined in the MS  Windows/3.0  \"windows.h\"\\tinclude\\t file.\\n    Palette  information  needs\\t to  be\\t stored for images that are not 24-bit\\n    images.  The five general steps are:\\n\\t 1.  Filling  in  the  BITMAPFILEHEADER\\t  and\\tthe   BITMAPINFOHEADER\\n\\t     structures the basic image information.\\n\\t 2.  If the image is a 1-bit, 4-bit, or an 8-bit image,\\t creating  the\\n\\t     color palette of RGBQUADS.\\n\\t 3.  Calculating the total file size and putting this  information  in\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t      March 15, 1991\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t    - 4 -\\n\\n\\n\\t     the \"bfSize\" field of the BITMAPFILEHEADER.\\n\\t 4.  Calculating the offset to the image data from the\\tstart  of  the\\n\\t     file,   and   putting  this  in  the  \"bfOffBits\"\\tfield  of  the\\n\\t     BITMAPFILEHEADER.\\n\\t 5.  Writing to the file the BITMAPFILEHEADER,\\tthe  BITMAPINFOHEADER,\\n\\t     the color palette, and the image data (in that order).\\n\\n    The following sections describe structures in terms of MicroSoft  C\\t type-\\n    defined  keywords.\\tThe following table describes these keywords for those\\n    not familiar with MicroSoft C.\\n\\n\\t\\t     _______________________________________\\n\\t\\t    |\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   |\\n\\t\\t    | Type-defined keywords in MicroSoft C.|\\n\\t\\t    |______________________________________|\\n\\t\\t    | typedef |\\t meaning\\t\\t   |\\n\\t\\t    |_________|____________________________|\\n\\t\\t    | BYTE    |\\t unsigned character\\t   |\\n\\t\\t    | WORD    |\\t two byte unsigned integer |\\n\\t\\t    | DWORD   |\\t four byte unsigned integer|\\n\\t\\t    |_________|____________________________|\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t      March 15, 1991\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t    - 5 -\\n\\n\\n    THE BITMAPFILEHEADER\\n\\n    This structure is defined in \"windows.h\" as:\\n\\t typedef struct tagBITMAPFILEHEADER {\\n\\t\\t WORD\\t bfType;\\n\\t\\t DWORD\\t bfSize;\\n\\t\\t WORD\\t bfReserved1;\\n\\t\\t WORD\\t bfReserved2;\\n\\t\\t DWORD\\t bfOffBits;\\n\\t } BITMAPFILEHEADER;\\n\\n    The \"bfType\" field is the two ascii characters \\'B\\' and \\'M\\'.\\t  This\\tserves\\n    to\\tidentify  the  file  as\\t a  DIB\\t image file.  On an intel byte ordered\\n    machine (IBM or a compatible), this constant can be formed\\tin  C  as  the\\n    quantity (\\'M\\' << 8 | \\'B\\') == 0x4d42 on an intel system.\\n\\n    The \"bfSize\" field is the total size of the file.  For our\\tpurposes  this\\n    field  is equal to: the size of the BITMAPFILEHEADER, plus the size of the\\n    BITMAPINFOHEADER, plus the number of entries in the\\t color\\tpalette\\t times\\n    the\\t size  of  a  RGBQUAD, plus the number of bytes of image data.\\tIf the\\n    image data is being written out in an uncompressed form, this value can be\\n    calculated\\tahead  of  time.   Otherwise, this field needs to be filled in\\n    later.\\n\\n    Both the \"bfReserved1\" and the \"bfReserved2\"  fields  are  always  set  to\\n    zero.\\n\\n    The \"bfOffBits\" field is set to the offset to the start of the image  data\\n    from  the  start  of the file.  For our purposes, this field should be set\\n    to:\\t the  size  of\\tthe   BITMAPFILEHEADER,\\t  plus\\t the   size   of   the\\n    BITMAPINFOHEADER,  plus  the  number of entries in the color palette times\\n    the size of a RGBQUAD.  This works out because the image data  is  written\\n    write after the color palette if one exists.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t      March 15, 1991\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t    - 6 -\\n\\n\\n    THE BITMAPINFOHEADER\\n\\n    This structure is defined in \"windows.h\" as:\\n\\t typedef struct tagBITMAPINFOHEADER{\\n\\t\\t DWORD\\t biSize;\\n\\t\\t DWORD\\t biWidth;\\n\\t\\t DWORD\\t biHeight;\\n\\t\\t WORD\\t biPlanes;\\n\\t\\t WORD\\t biBitCount;\\n\\t\\t DWORD\\t biCompression;\\n\\t\\t DWORD\\t biSizeImage;\\n\\t\\t DWORD\\t biXPelsPerMeter;\\n\\t\\t DWORD\\t biYPelsPerMeter;\\n\\t\\t DWORD\\t biClrUsed;\\n\\t\\t DWORD\\t biClrImportant;\\n\\t } BITMAPINFOHEADER;\\n\\n    The \"biSize\" field is set to the size of  the  BITMAPINFOHEADER  structure\\n    itself.   When  reading  the  image\\t file,\\tthis  value is what is used to\\n    determine  that  the  image\\t contains  a  BITMAPINFOHEADER\\t and   not   a\\n    BITMAPCOREHEADER.\\n\\n    The \"biWidth\" field is the width of the image in image pixels.\\n\\n    The \"biHeight\" field is the height of the image in image lines.\\n\\n    The \"biPlanes\" field should always be set to 1.  This data is written  out\\n    as if there was one color plane.\\n\\n    The \"biBitCount\" field is the bit-depth of the image.  This must be either\\n    1, 4, 8, or 24, depending on the bit-depth of the image data.\\n\\n    The \"biCompression\" field tells how the image data is compressed if it  is\\n    compressed.\\t   DIB\\timages\\tsupport\\t two  forms  of\\t run-length  encoding.\\n    However, I have never seen any images which use it, and don\\'t know yet how\\n    it works.  Set this field to zero (long zero, or 0L), to indicate that the\\n    data is not compressed.\\n\\n    All subsequent fields of the BITMAPINFOHEADER  structure  may  be  set  to\\n    zero.   A  requirement  of\\tthe  interpretting software that it be able to\\n    compute these fields as necessary from the previous information.\\n\\n    The field which you might want to explicitly specify might be \"biClrUsed\".\\n    For\\t 4-bit\\tand  8-bit  images  this  field\\t indicates that not all of the\\n    possible color entries are used and that the  image\\t contains  \"biClrUsed\"\\n    colors.  If you are using only 32 colors with an 8-bit image, then you may\\n    only want to save 32 of the possible 256 palette entries.  Generally,  set\\n    this field to zero.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t      March 15, 1991\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t    - 7 -\\n\\n\\n    COLOR PALETTES\\n\\n    Each entry of a  color  palette  is\\t a  RGBQUAD  structure.\\t  The  RGBQUAD\\n    structure is defined in the \"windows.h\" include file as:\\n\\t typedef struct tagRGBQUAD {\\n\\t\\t BYTE\\t rgbBlue;\\n\\t\\t BYTE\\t rgbGreen;\\n\\t\\t BYTE\\t rgbRed;\\n\\t\\t BYTE\\t rgbReserved;\\n\\t } RGBQUAD;\\n    The \"rgbReserved\" field is always zero.  For each color used,  the\\tamount\\n    of Blue, Green, and Red are filled into the structure and the structure is\\n    written to the file.  A value of zero in  the  \"rgbBlue\",  \"rgbGreen\",  or\\n    \"rgbRed\"   fields  indicates  that\\tthat  particular  component  does  not\\n    contribute to the color composition.  A value  of  255  in\\tany  of\\t these\\n    fields  indicates  that  the  component  contributes  fully\\t to  the color\\n    composition.\\n\\n\\n\\n    IMAGE DATA\\n\\n    There are three surprises about the ordering of image data\\tin  DIB\\t image\\n    file.   The\\t creator  of  this  format  was determined to be creative, and\\n    certainly was.\\n\\n    Within the image data, each line written out is padded to  the  next  four\\n    byte  quantity.   So,  if  you had an 8-bit image which was only one pixel\\n    wide, you still have to write out four bytes for every  image  line.   The\\n    number of bytes per line can be calculated as:\\n\\n\\t\\t bytes_per_line = (width_in_pix * bit_depth + 31 ) / 32 * 4;\\n\\n\\t---or, in terms of the fields of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure---\\n\\n\\t\\t bytes_per_line = (biWidth * biBitCount + 31 ) / 32 * 4;\\n\\n\\n    When writing out your image data, you must write it out bottom line first.\\n    The\\t bottom line of the image as you would look at it on the screen is the\\n    first line of image data in the file.\\n\\n    For 1-bit, 4-bit, and 8-bit images, information is written\\tas  you\\t would\\n    expect.   One  bit\\timages\\tare  padded  eight pixels to a byte.  Four bit\\n    images are padded two pixels to a byte.  Eight bit images are written  one\\n    pixel per byte.  Twenty-four bit images are written three bytes per pixel.\\n    However, for 24-bit images the information must  be\\t written  out  in  the\\n    order  blue,  green, red.

The Germans got a\\nmatch penalty and a 10 minutes misconduct for practically nothing and\\nseconds after that the German goalie got two minutes for \"delay of game\"\\nfor a shot that was deflected and went into the crowd.

Goggin)\\nSubject: Dreams and out of body incidents\\nLines: 38\\n\\nhey folks,\\n\\nI'm fairly new to these groups, tho' some have heard from me before.\\n\\nI'd like to get your comments on a question that has been on my mind a\\nlot:  What morals/ethics apply to dreams and out-of-body incidents?\\nIn normal dreams, you can't control anything, so obviously\\nyou aren't morally responsible for your actions.  But if you can contrive\\nto control the action in dreams or do an OOBE, it seems like a morality applies.\\n\\nNow, there seem to be 3 alternatives:\\n\\n1) Dreams and OOBEs are totally mental phenomena.  In this case no morality\\napplies beyond what might be called 'mental hygiene', that is, not trying\\nto think about anything evil, or indulgining in overly sexy or violent\\nthoughts.\\n\\n2) Dreams and OOBEs have a reality of their own (i.e. are 'another plane')\\nEvidence for this is that often dreams and OOBEs are sometimes done in\\ncommon by more than one person.  A\\nmark of objective fact is that >1 people report the same objective experience.\\nIn this case, the same interpersonal morality/ethics applies in dreams and\\nOOBEs as does in waking life.\\n\\n3) Like (2), but here we assume that though the dreeam and OOBE environs have a\\nreal existence, a different moral/ethics apply there, and no (or maybe \\ndifferent) moral laws apply there.\\n\\nSo... There it is.  Is one of these cases the truth, or does anyone know\\nof another alternative?  respond by post or email.\\n\\nthanks very much\\n\\n*dt*\\n\\n========================================================\\n\\n.\\n\" => alt.atheism \n",

Special agent (asshole actually) Ricks stated that\\nDavid Koresh had \"explosives that could blow up an armored vehicle 40\\nfeet into the air.\"  It looked like to me that the BDs had plenty of\\nopportunity to use these explosives---provided that they had them in the\\nfirst place.  For example, when one of the tanks was injecting CS gas\\ninto the ranch house (yes ranch house; the BDs weren\\'t living in a\\nfortress) they could have easily destroyed or disabled that tank because\\nit was idling there for a considerable length of time.  So, why didn\\'t\\nthey do this?  Could it be that they didn\\'t have any explosives or\\nsimilar munitions?  I just don\\'t buy what the ATF and FBI have been\\nsaying.  Hopefully, the truth will come out.\\n\\nHere\\'s something noteworthy:  after the fire had been burning for some\\ntime an explosion occurred---just *one* explosion.  The media said that\\nthis was some of the explosives that the BDs posessed going off.  I\\ndon\\'t think this was the case.  My brother and I noticed that this\\nso-called \"explosion\" resembled a plume of propane gas being ignited.\\nWe figure that this is what it was because of how the \"explosion\"\\nlooked and sounded.  Obviously, it wasn\\'t due to something like TNT,\\ndynamite, or C4.  I have seen a propane explosion before...the explosion\\nin the ranch house greatly resembled this.  Also, I noticed something\\nthat looked like a propane tank in the charred ruble the next day.\\n\\nIsn\\'t it curious that the ATF wasn\\'t very forthcoming about how the four\\nofficers got killed?  Many weeks had gone by before they stated that\\nsome of the officers had been killed and/or wounded by grenades thrown\\nby the BDs.  Earlier, when someone asked one of the spokespersons about\\nwhether or not an autopsy had been performed on the slain agents, they\\nsaid that an autopsy had been done but THEY WEREN\\'T READY TO RELEASE\\nTHE FINDINGS.  Now why is this?  Does the ATF have something to hide?\\nPerhaps those four agents were killed by friendly fire.  What is the\\ncause of death exactly?  NO ONE HAS EVER SAID WHAT IT IS.\\n\\nWhat is certain is this:  ATF agents *did* throw grenades into the\\ncompound.  As a matter of fact, Mr. Koresh handed his lawyer a grenade\\nbody during one of the lawyer\\'s visits to the compound.  Later on\\nthe lawyer gave the grenade body (I don\\'t know if it was a dud or a\\nspent one btw) to the ATF.  How much do you want to bet that this\\ngrenade will mysteriously disappear?  At this point in time the only\\npeople we know who had grenades was the ATF agents.  Wouldn\\'t it be\\na shocker if the no one ever found any evidence of grenades, rockets,\\nor explosives in the rubble?  The ATF would sure have egg on their\\nface then.  Note that the ATF is doing the *initial* sweep of the\\nrubble.  The FBI and the Texas Rangers won\\'t investigate until the\\nATF is done.  This looks like a perfect opportunity for the ATF to\\nmake sure that others \"find\" what they want for them to \"find\" if\\nyou know what I mean.  I\\'m probably being a little paranoid here\\nbut if I am I have could reason to be.  Recall that several weeks\\nhad gone by before anyone said that the BDs had used grenades.\\nAlso recall that early on the ATF had *denied* that their agents\\nused grenades on the BDs.

      "\"Subject: Flames Final Stats and Playoff News\\nFrom: caldwell8102@mtroyal.ab.ca\\nOrganization: Mount Royal College, Calgary, Alberta\\nLines: 118\\n\\nNews:\\n=====\\nFor the first time all season, the Flames are now injury-free. The only player\\nremaining on the limp is center Carey Wilson who, even when healthy, is not \\na major part of the team. \\n\\nTrent Yawney did not score a goal all season until the last regular season\\ngame against San Jose. He potted his first of the year in that game, and has\\nalso scored goals in both Game 1 and Game 2 against Los Angeles. \\n\\nThoughts on Game 1:\\n==================\\n\\nThe Flames played horribly in dropping the first game of their series with\\nLos Angeles 6-3 on Sunday afternoon. They seemed more interested in throwing\\nbig hits than in scoring goals. They physically dominated the Kings, but that\\nwas the only area they dominated in. The game plan was to rush the net and \\ntry and take advantage of a young, inexperienced L.A. defence and the shaky\\nKings goaltending, but those plans fell by the wayside while the Flames\\nconducted a steady march to the penalty box. Particularily stupid was Theoren\\nFleury taking a five minute major and a game misconduct for slamming Warren\\nRychel's face into the dasher while Rychel was on his knees. \\n\\nGoaltender Mike Vernon played well and could not really be faulted for the\\nloss, despite his well-publicized poor record in afternoon games. He got\\nvery little support from his defence in clearing the front of the net and \\nsweeping away rebounds. In fact, Marty McSorley's goal actually went in off\\nChris Dahlquist's skate in front of the net. \\n\\nThoughts on Game 2:\\n==================\\n\\nThe Flames came back strong in the second game, evidently aware of the\\npotentially fatal consequences of losing both the first two games on home ice.\\nThe first period was fairly even, with the edge going to the Kings. But Calgary\\ncame out strong in the second period and simply dominated the Kings, scoring\\nfive goals to take a lead they never relinquished en route to a 9-4 win. \\n\\nThe deciding factors in this game were faceoffs and special teams. Calgary\\ndominated on faceoffs as they did in Game 1, but they were able to make better\\nuse of the won faceoffs in this game than they did in the first one. Calgary\\nalso went 3-for-5 on the powerplay while L.A. only went 1-for-8 and gave up\\na shorthanded goal to Joel Otto. L.A.'s powerplay goal also came late in the\\ngame with the outcome already decided. The Kings' powerplay failed them when\\nthey needed it most, in the 1st and 2nd periods. \\n\\nThe Flames lost RW Greg Paslawski with a suspected shoulder injury when he\\nwas leveled by Alexei Zhitnik right after scoring Calgary's 7th goal. Charlie\\nHuddy left the game for the Kings with a groin injury. \\n\\nThe game was marred by stupidity in the last minute. First, Craig Berube of\\nCalgary took a five-minute major for fighting plus a game misconduct for\\ninstigating when he went after Tony Granato for no apparent reason. Granato\\ndrew a minor for some strange reason. (Turtling perhaps). This was followed\\n30 seconds later by Warren Rychel drawing a major, minor, and game misconduct\\nfor hitting Frank Musil in the face with his stick and then instigating a\\nfight. Musil got a fighting major for some similarily strange reason. Hardy and\\nYawney went toe-to-toe and both got double minors. (Gregson thought that Musil \\nturtling amounted to fighting, but that Yawney and Hardy throwing punches at \\neach other was just roughing?

I have refered you to the FAQ\\nfiles, which I find out, no longer contains them.  They are too long for me to\\nmail to each of you, each article, but will try to get them back on the FAQ\\nfile.  \\n\\nBecause of the renewed interest on this subject, I will type, with permission,\\nan article by James DeYoung.  I think it is one of the best articles that I\\'ve\\nread todate from the conservative position.  I can\\'t post it all at once, so it\\nwill come piece meal and not daily.  After I\\'m done retyping the entire\\narticle, I will make it available for the FAQ file.  Talk to clh.\\n\\nAlso, for those who can\\'t get through to me, you may try one of these:\\nREXLEX@FNAL.FNAL.GOV \\nLEXREX@ALMOND.FNAL.GOV\\nLoren Senders@ADMAIL.FNAL.GOV\\n\\n                              THE SOURCE AND NT MEANING\\n                         OF ARSENOKOITAI, WITH IMPLICATIONS\\n                         FOR CHRISTIAN ETHICS AND MINISTRY\\n\\n\\n                                      James B. DeYoung\\n                               Professor of New Testament\\n                         Western Conservative Baptist Seminary\\n                                      Portland, Oregon\\n\\n     Traditional interpretation of arsenokoitai (\"homosexuals\") in 1 Cor 6:9\\nand 1 Tim 1:10 refers to sexual vice between people of the same sex,\\nspecifically homosexualitiy.  Some restrict the term\\'s meaning to \"active male\\nprostititute,\" but stronger evidence supports a more general translation,\\nnamely \"homosexuals.\"  More recently the definition \"homosexual\" has been\\nopposed on clutural and linguistic grounds, the claim being that the term\\n\"homosexuals\" is anachronistic.  In addition, criticism of the traditional\\nrendering says the term today includes celibate homophiles, excludes\\nheterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts, and includes female homosexuals. \\nA concern for acts instead of the modern attention to desires was the only\\nfactor in the ancient world.  The foregoing oppositition to the translation of\\narsenokoitai by \"homosexuals\" has a number of debilitating weaknesses. \\nFinally, this study argues that Paul coined the term arsenokoitai, deriving it\\nfrom the LXX of Lev 20:12 (cf. 18:22) and using it for homosexual orientation\\nand behavior, the latter of which should be an occasion for church discipline\\n(I Cor 5-6) and legislation in society (1 Tim 1:8-11).\\n\\n                      *************************************\\n\\n                                   INTRODUCTION\\n\\n     Coincident with the rise of the gay rights movement in recent years has\\nbeen an increasing focus on the biblical statements regarding homosexuality or\\nsodomy.    As part of this focus, the meaning of the term arsenokoitai, used\\ntwice by the apostle Paul (1 Cor 6:9,  I Tim 1:10), has received vigorous\\nscrutiny.    This issue is particularly crucial to contemporary society since\\nso much of modern ethics is shaped by biblical statements.  More particularly, \\nthe concern over gay rights and the place of gays or homosexuals in the church\\nand in society require the resolution of biblical interpretation.\\n\\n     This study of historical, linguistic, and literary matters will survey and\\nevalutate recent proposals for the meaning of arsenokoitai and present evidence\\nto point to a resolution.  Several writers and their positions represent the\\nmodern debate on this word.  Three authors, Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs, have\\nprovoked considerable discussion and significantly encouraged the wider\\nacceptance of the homosexual lifestyle in society, in the church, and in the\\nministry. \\n\\n\\nFootnotes:\\n_______________________\\n 1.  For convenience sake, the term \"homosexual\" is used to encompass both\\nsame-sex orientation and same-sex behavior.  The meaning of this term is one of\\nthe main considerations of this study.\\n 2. These times are differnt from just over a century ago.  Then P Fairbairn\\n(Pastoral Epistles [Edinburg, 1874)  891) could write of arsenokoitai thit it\\nis a \"term for which fortunately our language has no proper equivalent.\" \\nUnknowingly he thereby touched upon the basis for the contemporary debate and\\nstudy.  THe present writer endorses the Pauline authorship of the Pastoral\\nEpistles on the basis of internal and external evidence (see Donald Guthrie,\\nNew Testament Introduction, [4th ed;  1990] 621-649, for an extensive\\ndiscussion and citation of supporters of the Pauline authorship).\\n 3. For example, see Scroggs\\' influence on M. Olson, \"Untangling the Web,\" The\\nOther Side (April 1984): 24-29.  For a study suggesting a further prohibition\\nof homosexuality in the OT, see A. Phillips, \"Unconvering the Father\\'s Skirt,\"\\nVT 30/1 (Jan, 1980) 38-43.  For a bibliography of other sources dealing with\\narsenokoitai, see the Wisondisc Religion Indexes (NY: H. Wison Co., 1987).\\n' => alt.atheism \n",

I don\\'t think so, not from what I heard. He lived\\n>ONE DAY of suffering and died. If the wages of sin is the above paragraph, then\\n>JESUS DIDN\\'T PAY FOR OUR SINS, DID HE?\\n\\nThis is something I\\'ve always found a little curious. I\\'ve never quite understood\\nthe trinity thing. On the one hand, Jesus is supposed to be God incarnate. But,\\nat the same time, he is God\\'s son \"For God so loved the world that he gave his\\nonly begotten son\". First question is, if Jesus was God in human form, how could\\nhe really be God\\'s son? If the Holy Ghost \"planted the seed\" in Mary, so to speak,\\nthen it seems that Jesus\\' relationship to God would be the equivalent to the\\nhuman father/son relationship. While a son might inherit alot of the father\\'s \\nqualities, he is not the father. They are still two separite entities. To try\\nand say that a son is the same person as the father is obviously wrong. In that\\ncase, Jesus and God aren\\'t the same. On the other hand, if their relationship\\nisn\\'t the same as the human father/son relationship, but Jesus is actually God\\nincarnate, then he\\'s not really God\\'s son and he never was. He\\'s just God\\nmanifesting himself as Jesus. At least, this is how I\\'m seeing it. Can someone\\nwho is more knowledgeable about the trinity enlighten us? \\n\\nGetting back to the original question, what is the great price that Jesus paid\\nto redeem our sins? Was it dying on the cross? Since Jesus knew that he would\\nrise again in 3 days and then ascend back to heaven, I have a hard time seeing\\nhow this is considered paying such a great price for humanity. His earthly body\\nmay have been killed, but then, so what? He suffered a few hours of physical\\npain, but then, there has been many a human who has suffered a great deal more.\\nThe fact that Jesus was God\\'s only begotten son doesn\\'t seem to me to have much\\nmeaning since God can beget as many sons as he wants to. Jesus being the only\\none was simply a matter of choice. I suspect that these questions will be very\\noffensive to many Christians on this net. To those people, please accept my\\nsincere apologies. It is not my intention to offend or to trivialize Christ.\\nBut, I do believe these are legitimate questions and I am genuinely curious.\\n \\n[Note that the Trinity and Incarnation have to be looked at together.\\nFirst, your reading of the Virgin Birth is an uncommon one.  (In this\\ngroup, it\\'s dangerous to say that no one believes something.)  You\\nseem to be suggesting the Jesus is God\\'s son in a physical sense,\\nwith the Holy Spirit as Father and Mary as Mother.  I consider that\\nterrible heresy, though some people react less violently.  The Virgin\\nBirth says that Jesus\\' birth is God\\'s responsibility.  But it doesn\\'t\\nimply that God\\'s sperm was involved.  Indeed one (though by no means\\nthe only) speculation is that God used Joseph\\'s genetic material.\\n\\nSecond, Jesus is in some sense doubly indirect from the Father.  In a\\nTrinitarian context, the term Son refers to the eternal Logos, who is\\na part of God.  The Son didn\\'t come into existence with Jesus\\' birth.\\nJesus is the incarnation of the Son.  So his sonness isn\\'t\\nspecifically a result of being incarnated.  Rather, it\\'s the Son\\nwho was incarnated.\\n\\n--clh]\\n' => soc.religion.christian \n",

I love it,\\nbut I am not very familiar with the different denominations, or\\ntraditions, or common beliefs of various christian groups.\\nI have heard various people (outside this news group)\\ndescribe *idols* such as power, money, material \\npossessions etc.  These things are worshiped in some sense I \\nsuppose, but I never really gave idols much thought.  Until now...  \\n\\nI have been reading the postings in this news group (which I \\njust found a few days ago), and I have a question...  First, I\\'m\\nnot trying to question anyone\\'s belief or try to push my views\\non anyone else (I haven\\'t been at this long enough to have\\nany views other than I cannot get to heaven by being good,\\nI must understand that Christ bore my sins on the cross so that\\nI could be saved and I need to repent, i.e. realize that\\nevery time I sin, I might as well stick a sharp stick in\\nChrist\\'s side because He took the punishment for my sins,\\nwhen He died on the cross).\\n\\nIn my studies, Mary never really comes up.  I know who she is, \\nbut that\\'s about it.  It seems to me that a statue of Mary \\ncould be considered an idol?  Do people pray to statues of Mary?\\n\\nIt sounds like educated christians (more educated than myself\\nI\\'m sure) believe Mary was sinless?  Wow...  I hoped to spend\\nthe summer convincing myself (one way or the other) about\\nTongues (I\\'m reading \"Charismatic Chaos\").  I guess I\\'ll study\\nTongues in parallel with reading this news group.  Any help you can \\ngive me will be appreciated.\\n\\n    -------------------------------------------\\n\\n[I don\\'t think the issue is so much that people are more educated than\\nyou (though it may well be that they are), as that they come from a\\ndifferent tradition than yours.\\n\\nThis is a discussion between Catholics and Protestants.  Catholics\\ngenerally believe that Mary was sinless.  Protestants do not.  The\\nissue comes down to different sources of authority.  Protestants\\ngenerally limit themselves to the Bible as a source of doctrine.\\nSince this isn\\'t in the Bible (except in passages that no one would\\nunderstand in this way if they didn\\'t already believe it), Protestants\\ndon\\'t accept it.  Catholics see continuing revelation through the\\nChurch, though they believe the results are consistent with the Bible.\\n\\nI interpret your posting, not as a call for yet another argument about\\nwhether the Catholic Marian devotions are idolatry (an argument I am\\nnot prepared to see newed here), but as a sign of being interested in\\nlearning about traditions other than your own.  Catholics are of\\ncourse a major one, but by no means the only one.  I generally\\nconsider the major traditions to be Catholic, Orthodox, and\\nvarious subsets of Protestantism.  Within Protestantism, it\\'s a matter\\nof how finely you want to cut things.  These days I think the major\\ndivision is between those who accept Biblical inerrancy and those\\nwho don\\'t.  There are also a number of major historical traditions,\\nbut in recent decades distinctions are tending to blur.  I\\'d \\nidentify the major Protestant traditions as:\\n\\n  Lutheran, Reformed, Anglican (they\\'re sort of halfway between\\n  Catholic and Protestant), Wesleyan, Baptist, Holiness, Pentecostal,\\n  Church of Christ\\n\\nBut there are a number of others.  Historical distinctions tend not to\\nbe so important among the liberal churches anymore, and I think\\ncurrent trends in society and the Church are also tending to make\\nconservatives seen themselves as allies from a general \"evangelical\"\\nperspective.  But differences among these various traditions are still\\nquite marked.\\n\\nI think the best introduction to these issues is to read a good book\\non church history.  Anyone who wants to understand the church really\\nneeds to understand how we got where we are now.  A church history\\nwill normally show you where each of these traditions came from, and\\ngive a feeling for their nature.  Unfortunately I\\'m away from my\\nlibrary at the moment, so I don\\'t have anything specific to recommend.\\n\\n--clh]\\n' => soc.religion.christian \n",

If I try to add throttle much past 5000 rpm, power drops\\ndrastically.  Put simply, under load, the engine won't rev past 5000\\nrpm.  The top third/half of the throttle range is dead.  Standing still\\nthe engine runs fine up to red line (9-10K).\\n\\nOther phenomenology: at about the point that power loss kicks in, the\\nengine becomes a little wavery.  That is, at a steady throttle the\\nengine speed goes up and down slightly.  The bike has about 13000 miles\\non it and is in good tune, at least until it starts to balk.\\n\\nI would appreciate any suggestions as to what's ailing the poor beast. \\nMy thoughts run toward clogged jets and/or improper spark advance.

I find the\\ntranslation of Col 2 above odd in terms of the circumcision of christ,\\nwhich the KJV and RSV put in terms of Christ\\'s cricumcision which we, in\\nunion with him *participate* in putting off the body of sins of the flesh.\\n\\nAlso, perhaps cor 2:12 is dividing the act of burial with him in baptism,\\nwhich can be independant of faith, from the experience of rising with\\nChrist by faith. Who says both are by faith? This interpretation has the\\nadvantage of explaining those who are faithlessly baptized, for whom their\\nbaptisim is not benefit, but serves to put them into the kingdom nonetheless.\\n\\nLike the israelites (all of them, children included) who were baptized in\\nthe cloud and in the sea, it was of no advantage because they did not add\\nto their baptism faith and obedience.\\n\\nBaptism does not impart faith, nor is it done strictly speaking on the\\nbasis of the faith of the parent, but because of the covcenant promise of\\nGod. It imparts grace, the grace of the kingdom, which can be a\\npunishement in disguise if there is later apostacy.\\n\\n\\n>\\n>Romans 10:16-17 \"But not all the Israelites accepted the good news.

The problem with a \"moment of\\nsilence\" is that it is NOT an even-handed way of \"allowing\" for religion\\namongst students in the public schools.  As I noted before, Muslims need\\nmore than a moment of silence in order to perform the prayers they are\\nrequired by Muhammad to do.  And (at least Orthodox) Jewish prayer also\\nhas requirements that are not addressed by this.\\n\\nThere is, in fact, a highly selective BIAS towards Christian prayer in\\nthis \"moment of silence\" shit.  And that is especially bizarre in that\\nChristian prayer DOESN\\'T NEED this stuff -- a Christain may pray totally\\nincognito AT ANY TIME (to some extent, this is true of Muslims and Jews\\nas well -- what I intend in my first paragraph is that there *are* some\\ncharacteristic forms of prayer in *these* religions which DO need special\\ntimes and/or behavior, which cannot be undertaken without an observer \\nbeing able taking note of it.)\\n\\nA Christian may pray, at ANY time -- silently and without any trace of\\nhis activity being evident to others.  That may or may not be true of the\\nother religious traditions amongst us: certainly, these tend to have SOME\\nforms of prayer that WOULD evidence differences from American/Protestant\\n\"mainstream\" religion.\\n\\nAll that a \"moment of silence\" does is to allow THAT ONE tradition which\\ndoesn\\'t NEED it, to have a \"special\" place set aside in the public schools.\\nThere is NOTHING in Christian prayer that requires public forms, or rugs,\\nor phylacteries, or anything else at all visible to the outside world.  A\\nChristian student MAY (and probably does) pray at innumerable times during\\nthe day, without anyone else knowing it.  [That may also be true of non-\\nChristians -- I am not claimng otherwise].  In the \"moment of silence\" it\\nwould STILL be difficult for the Jews to gather and daven, for the Muslims\\nto do their ablutions and find qiblah to Mecca and engage in the prescribed\\nforms.  But *of course* Christians can do *their* thing -- and therefore,\\nthe provision is nothing but a disguised attempt to encourage just that.\\n\\nLuckily, there *is* a strong Jewish presence in this country (and I, as\\na Christian, revere some of the Jewish teachers I had in public schools),\\nand a growing Muslim presence as well.  I can only hope that the political\\nforces consequent on this will PREVENT the imposition of Christian forms\\non non-Christians.\\n\\nAs far as I can see (as a Christian) there is NOTHING in this \"moment of\\nsilence\" campaign but an attempt to use PUBLIC social pressure to FORCE\\nchildren to adhere to a pattern that is biased towards Christianity.  And\\nas a Christian, I *must* protest such coercion.  For what it\\'s worth, I\\nsuspect that the coercion is not really targeted at the non-Christians --\\nit is yet another case of FAILURE amongst Christian parents in \"making\"\\ntheir children prayerful, so that they want the public schools to teach\\nwhat THEY cannot manage to teach, despite having all the opportunity in\\nthe world to do so.\\n\\nIf you have taught your children to pray, they do NOT need a moment of\\nsilence in school.

For if they had\\nhad previous lives, it would not make sense to say, \"Neither of them\\nhas done anything good or bad as yet, since they are not yet born.\"\\n\\nDaniel Cossack writes to ask whether it is fair for God to hate\\nEasau when Esau has done nothing bad?\\n\\nI reply that in Hebrew it is standard usage to speak of hating when\\nwhat is meant is simply putting in second place. As an example,\\nconsider the saying in Matthew 6:24\\n\\n + No man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one\\n + and love the other, or....\\n\\nNow, it is obviously false that a man with two masters must hate one\\nof them. But it is obviously true that he must put one of them in\\nsecond place. A dog that always comes when either Billy or Bobby\\ncalls will have a problem if they stand in different places and call\\nsimultaneously. It cannot give first priority to both.

      "'From: trajan@cwis.unomaha.edu (Stephen McIntyre)\\nSubject: Theists And Objectivity\\nOrganization: University of Nebraska at Omaha\\nLines: 82\\n\\nCan a theist be truly objective?  Can he be impartial\\n     when questioning the truth of his scriptures, or\\n     will he assume the superstition of his parents\\n     when questioning? \\n\\nI\\'ve often found it to be the case that the theist\\n     will stick to some kind of superstition when\\n     wondering about God and his scriptures.  I\\'ve\\n     seen it in the Christian, the Jew, the Muslim,\\n     and the other theists alike.  All assume that\\n     their mothers and fathers were right in the\\n     aspect that a god exists, and with that belief\\n     search for their god.\\n     \\nOccasionally, the theist may switch religions or\\n     aspects of the same religion, but overall the\\n     majority keep to the belief that some \"Creator\"\\n     was behind the universe\\'s existence.  I\\'ve\\n     known Muslims who were once Christians and vice\\n     versa, I\\'ve known Christians who were once\\n     Jewish and vice versa, and I\\'ve even known\\n     Christians who become Hindu.  Yet, throughout\\n     their transition from one faith to another,\\n     they\\'ve kept this belief in some form of higher\\n     \"being.\"  Why?\\n     \\nIt usually all has to do with how the child is\\n     brought up.  From the time he is born, the\\n     theist is brought up with the notion of the\\n     \"truth\" of some kind of scripture-- the Bible,\\n     the Torah, the Qur\\'an, & etc.  He is told\\n     of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired)\\n     the scripture, of the prophets talked about in\\n     the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc.\\n     He is also told that to question this (as\\n     children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime\\n     against God, and to lose belief in the scrip-\\n     ture\\'s truth is to damn one\\'s soul to Hell.\\n     Thus, by the time he is able to read the\\n     scripture for himself, the belief in its \"truth\"\\n     is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a\\n     matter of course.\\n     \\nBut it doesn\\'t stop there.  Once the child is able\\n     to read for himself, there is an endeavor to\\n     inculcate the child the \"right\" readings of\\n     scripture, to concentrate more on the pleasant\\n     readings, to gloss over the worse ones, and to\\n     explain away the unexplainable with \"mystery.\"\\n     Circular arguments, \"self-evdent\" facts and\\n     \"truths,\" unreasoning belief, and fear of\\n     hell is the meat of religion the child must eat\\n     of every day.  To doubt, of course, means wrath\\n     of some sort, and the child must learn to put\\n     away his brain when the matter concerns God.\\n     All of this has some considerable effect on the\\n     child, so that when he becomes an adult, the \\n     superstitions he\\'s been taught are nearly\\n     impossible to remove.\\n     \\nAll of this leads me to ask whether the theist can\\n     truly be objective when questioning God, Hell,\\n     Heaven, the angels, souls, and all of the rest.\\n     Can he, for a moment, put aside this notion that\\n     God *does* exist and look at everything from\\n     a unbiased point of view?  Obviously, most\\n     theists can somewhat, especially when presented\\n     with \"mythical gods\" (Homeric, Roman, Egyptian,\\n     & etc.).

As far as commercialization, that is\\n>a long ways off.  ...\\n> Anybody know anything further? Is this really news? Does this\\n>threaten further work on DC-? ?\\n  \\n   Boeing has been looking at several TSTO vehicles and has carried\\nout extensive conceptual studies of advanced launch systems for some\\ntime.  A good reference on this might be: \"Comparison of Propulsion\\nOptions for Advanced Earth-To-Orbit (ETO) Applications (IAF-92-\\n0639).\" by V.A. Weldon and L.E. Fink from Boeing.   The paper\\ndescribes a propane-fueled TSTO launch system claimed to achieve\\naircraft-like operational efficiencies without the problems\\nassociated with liquid hydrogen fuel.  Basically, it\\'s a high-speed\\nairplane launching a Hermes-type spaceplane\\n   The design (the concept is also called \"Beta\") as laid out in the\\npaper can launch at least 10,000 pounds into polar orbit, or 20,000\\npounds to space station orbit including a crew of eight persons and\\nlife support.  System design reliability is .9995.\\n   Beta is a 360-foot-long first stage powered by two large ramjets\\nand 12 high- speed civil transport (HSCT) turbofans.  A 108-foot-\\nlong reusable orbiter is trapeze-mounted in the belly of the first-\\nstage aircraft, which also could accommodate a longer and heavy\\npayload on an expendable second stage.\\n   To launch the orbital vehicle, the first stage takes off like a\\nnormal HSCT and accelerates to Mach 3.  At that point the turbofans,\\nmodified to burn catalyzed JP-7, would shut off and the ramjets,\\nwould take over.  At Mach 5.5 the orbiter or the ELV would swing\\nout, ignite and proceed to orbit. Both vehicles would land like\\naircraft at the conclusion of their respective missions.\\n   Estimated total weight of the combined configuration at takeoff\\nis about 1.5 M lbs, roughly equivalanet to a fully loaded An-225.\\nThe orbiter stages weighs about 400,Klbs including 335 Klbs\\nof LOX and subcooled propane to power two 250 Klbs vacuum thrust\\nrocket engines. Propellants would be stored at 91 degrees Kelvin,\\nwith the propane in a spherical tank mounted forward of the 15-by-\\n25-foot cargo bay and the two-seat orbiter crew station. LOX would\\nbe stored aft.  Weldon and Fink claim the key to this design\\'s\\nsuccess is the structurally efficient airframe and the compact\\ntankage allowed by the high-density supercooled hydrocarbon fuel.\\n     The paper compares TSTO design to SSTO design.  They conclude\\nwhile a SSTO has a slightly lower recurring cost, a TSTO is easier,\\ncheaper, and less risky to develop, simpler to build, has greater\\nsafety and mission versatility and doesn\\'t carry the hard-to-handle\\nand bulky hydrogen fuel. The conlcude \"In conjunction with its major\\nuse of airplane type engines and fuel, as well as its inherent self-\\nferry capability, it is probably the system most likely to provide\\nas close to airline-like operations as possible with a practical\\nconfiguration, until a single stage airbreather/rocket concept can\\nbe shown to be operationally viable.\"\\n  \\n>Is this really news? Does this threaten further work on DC-?\\n   Weldon and others at Boeing have been working on TSTO designs for\\nsome time.  I expect this, or a similar concept (perhaps the HTHL\\nSSTO they proposed for the SDIO SSTO first phase) is being re-\\nexamined as a basis for a bid on the first phase of SpaceLifter.\\n   Does it threaten DC-???.  Possibly -- There is a set of on-going\\nstudies trying straighten out the government\\'s future space\\ntransportation strategy.  MDC and Boeing (as well as other firms)\\nare providing data to a joint study team back in DC.  There are\\nvarious factions and options vying for attention -- including\\nshuttle upgrades, shuttle replacement (what was called the \"4-2-3\"\\narchitecture), SpaceLifter, ELV upgrades, and various advanced\\nvehicles (ALES, Beta, DC-??, NASP, FSTS, SSTOs of several types,\\netc.)  NASA/DOD/DOT are trying to put together a coherent strategy\\nfor future US gov\\'t space transportation systems, and trying to\\njuggle near-term launch needs (like for DoD and NASA) against\\nmedium-term needs (including commercial considerations), and against\\nthe investment and risk of going to \"leap frog\" new technologies\\nlike SDIO/SSTO and NASP and Beta.\\n   It\\'s a heck of a problem.  The worst part of the problem isn\\'t\\nthat there aren\\'t promising ideas and concepts -- there are dozens\\nof them -- but how they balance cost and risk versus real needs in\\nthe near term.  They should have a draft report in mid-June, with a\\nfinal report coming by the end of the fiscal year.\\n ------------------------------------------------------------------\\n Wales Larrison                           Space Technology Investor\\n  \\n\\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\\n' => sci.space \n",

I\\'ve \\nbeen compared to the famous Robert McElwaine by some readers of Sci. Med.\\nI didn\\'t know how to respond since I had not seen one of your posts(just \\nlike I haven\\'t read \"The Yeast Connection\").\\n\\nLet me just start by stating that the authors of the \"Cold Fusion\" papers of \\nrecent years are now in scientific exile(I believe that one has actually \\nleft the country).  Scientific fraud is rare.  I\\'m still not sure that if a \\nreview of the research notes of the \"cold fusion scientists\" actually \\nproved fraud or just very shoddy experimentation.\\n\\nYour sources do not seem to be research articles.  They are more like lay \\ntexts designed to pique human interest in a subject area(just like the food \\ncombining and life extension texts).  Robert, I try to keep an open mind.\\nBut some things I just can\\'t buy(one is taking SOD orally to prevent \\noxidative damage in the body).\\n\\nYour experiment, if conducted by readers of this news group, would prove \\nthat you are right(more ash after seed sprouting than before).  Unless you \\nuse a muffle furnance and obtain a very high temperature(above 600 degrees \\nI believe), you will get organic residue in the ash.  Even the residue in \\ncommercial incinerators contains organic residue.  I remember doing this \\nkind of experiment in my organic chemistry couurse in College but I \\ncouldn\\'t find a temperature for mineral ash formation so I\\'m really \\nguessing at 600 degrees F, it may actually be much higher.  The point is \\nthat no one in their home could ever get a high enough temperature to \\nproduce *only* a mineral ash.  They also could not measure the minerals so \\nthey could only weigh the ash and find out that you appear to be correct. \\n\\nChemical reactions abound in our body, in our atmosphere, in our water and \\nin our soil.  Are these fusion reactions?  Yes many of them do involve \\nfusing oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur to both organics and inorganics.  Do we \\nreally have the transformation of silicone to calcium if carbon is fused with \\nsilicon?  Not in my book Robert.\\n\\nSilicon is the most abundant mineral on our planet.  I\\'ve seen speculation \\nthat man could have evolved to be a silicon based rather than a carbon \\nbased life-form.  I like reading science fiction, as many people do.  But I \\nknow enough about biochemistry(and nutrition) to be able(in most cases) to \\nseparate the fiction from the fact.\\n\\nSilicon may be one of the trace elements that turns out to be essential in \\nhumans.  We have several grams of the stuff in our body.  What\\'s it doing \\nthere?  Only the Lord knows right now.  But I will tell you what I do know \\nabout silicon and why, as you state, it helps bone healing(and it is not \\nbecause silicon is transformed into calcium).\\n\\nAlmost all of the silicon in the human body is found in the connective \\ntissue(collagen and elastin).  There have been studies published which show \\nthat the very high silicon content in elastin may be an important protective \\nfactor against atherosclerosis(the higher the silicon content in elastin, \\nthe more resistant the elastin is to a an age-related loss of elasticity \\nwhich may play a role in the increase in blood pressure that is often seen as \\npart of the ageing process in humans).\\n\\nFor bone fracture healing, the first step is a collagen matrix into which \\ncalcium and phosphate are pumped by osteoblasts.  A high level of silicon \\nin the diet seems to speed up this matrix formation.  This first step in the \\nbone healing process seems to be the hardest for some people to get going.\\nElectriacl currents have been used in an attempt to get the matrix forming \\ncells oriented in the right direction so that the matrix can be formed in \\nthe gap(or gaps) between the ends of the broken bone.  A vitamin C deficiency\\n(by slowing collagen formation as well as causing the prodcution of \\ndefective collagen) does slow down both bone and wound healing.  Zinc is also \\nanother big player in bone and wound healing.  And so is silicon(in an  \\nundetermined role that most likely involes matrix formation and not \\ntransformation of silicon to calcium).  For you to take this bone healing \\nobservation and use it as proof that silicon is transformed into \\ncalcium is an interesting little trick.\\n\\nBut Robert, I have the same problem myself when I read the lay press(and \\nyes even some scientific papers).  Is the explanation reasonable?  Without \\na very good science knowledge base, you and most readers of this news group \\nare flying blind(you have to take it on faith because you don\\'t know any \\nbetter).\\n\\nIf the explanation seems to make sense to me based on my knowledge base, \\nI\\'m inclined to consider it(this usually means trying to find other sources \\nthat come to the same conclusion).  If the idea(like a candida bloom) seems \\nto make sense to me, I tend to pursue it as long as any advice that I\\'m \\ngoing to give isn\\'t going to really mess somebody up.  If this makes us \\nkindred souls Robert, then I guess I\\'ll have to live with that label.\\n\\nFor the physicians who have decided to read my response to Robert\\'s \\ninteresting post, I hope that you saw the segment on the pediatric \\nneurosurgeon last night on U.S. TV.  I can\\'t remember the network or his \\nname(like many nights, I was on my computer and my wife was watching TV in \\nour Den where I have my computer setup).  This neurosurgeon takes kids with \\nbrain tumors that everyone else has given up on and he uses\"unconventional\"\\ntreatments(his own words).  He says that he has a 70% success rate.  The one \\ncase that I heard him discussing would normally use radiation(conventional \\ntreatment).  He was going to go in and cut.  You guys complain about the \\ncost of the anti-fungals.  What do you think the cost difference between \\nradiation treatment and surgery is guys? \\n\\nI\\'m going to ask you guys one more time, why blast a physician who takes the \\nchronic sinus sufferer(like Jon) and the chronic GI sufferer(like Elaine)\\nand tries to help them using unconventional treatments?  Treatments which \\ndo not result in death(like those that the neurosurgeon uses?).  Is it \\nbecause candida blooms are not life-threatening while brain tumors are?\\nHow about quality of life guys?  May the candida demon never cross your \\nsinus cavity or gut(if it does, you may feel differently about the issue).\\n\\nMarty B.\\n' => alt.atheism \n",

Clipper is made available.\\n\\n  2.  Laws are passed to make use of cipher systems other than Clipper illegal\\n      (either on radio systems, or on any common carrier system).  These laws\\n      also include enforcement authority to listen across the relevant radio\\n      spectrum (or other medium), characterize signals, validate Clipper\\n      wrappers, detect probable use of non-Clipper ciphers, and make such\\n      detection a cause for further action.\\n\\n  3.  For escrowed keys to be useful, some specific Clipper chip must be\\n      associated with a suspected criminal.  This means that at a minimum\\n      some association between the common carrier\\'s unique phone ID (ESN) and\\n      the Clipper chip serial number N will be stored in a government database.\\n      An observed pairing of N and ESN other than the one recorded raises a\\n      red flag.\\n\\n  4.  To reduce ordinary fraud, the cellphone system which offers Clipper\\n      will also be constructed with an ESN mechanism much more tamper-proof\\n      and much less spoofable than today\\'s cellphones.\\n\\n  5.  Criminals want inscrutable communications.  Some criminals are not\\n      entirely stupid or ignorant, and will figure out both that Clipper\\n      cellphones offer excellent security in normal circumstances, and that\\n      they offer no security against law enforcement once a (presumably\\n      legitimate) wiretap order exists.  They will also figure out that the\\n      wiretap order must necessarily be against a specific cellphone, because\\n      each one has a unique unit key.\\n\\n  6.  Criminals do not want to call attention to themselves.  Because they\\n      are not stupid or ignorant (or because they read netnews), and because\\n      they know that their open use of a non-Clipper cipher is likely to be\\n      detected, they will generally avoid using non-Clipper ciphers directly\\n      on some monitorable/tappable channel.  They know that do so would raise\\n      a red flag, putting a given cellphone (if not a given person) under\\n      immediate suspicion.\\n\\n  7.  It is impractical to reverse engineer Skipjack, discover family key F,\\n      and construct a functional clone of a Clipper chip.\\n\\nBy #2, #3, #4, and #7 it will be very difficult to spoof a given Clipper\\nphone without immediate detection.  Because it is difficult to obscure one\\'s\\nassociation to a specific phone by reprogramming or changing chips\\naround, the criminal will be motivated to find an intact phone which is\\nassociated with someone else.\\n\\nA non-stupid criminal will conclude that they can have Clipper-secure\\ncommunications, at least for some limited time T, if they buy, beg, borrow,\\nor steal use of someone\\'s phone in a way that prevents that person from\\nreporting compromise of the phone for at least time T.  The encrypted\\ncommunications might have been recorded, and thus be retrievable later,\\nbut the criminal can delay, and quite likely evade, discovery by destroying\\nor abandoning the phone before T elapses.\\n\\nIt would be unusual for an innocent person to volunteer use of their Clipper\\nphone to someone else.  The honest subscriber doesn\\'t want to pay someone\\nelse\\'s bill, and he doesn\\'t want to fall under suspicion.\\n\\nThis leaves two sources of Clipper phones for criminal use: coercion\\nand collusion.\\n\\nCoercion first.  Theft bears a relatively low risk, but also sometimes\\na low time until detection (a few minutes if a phone is stolen from\\na car parked in front of a store, a couple of weeks if a phone is stolen\\nfrom someone who is away on vacation).  Criminal commerce is likely to\\narise in stolen Clipper phones, with phones coming from risk-inured poor\\ncriminals, and cash coming from risk-averse wealthy criminals.  Someone\\nwho is extraordinarily motivated to gain a day or two of undetected\\ncommunication (like a terrorist) could kill a person or hold them hostage.\\nThe limited time (before detection) that a coerced phone is useful means\\nthat continuing criminal enterprises require a continuing supply of\\nfreshly coerced phones.\\n\\nThere would also be created a collusive commerce between relatively\\nwealthy criminals, and ignorant or don\\'t-care patsies who need money,\\nand who will submit to being paid in return for subscribing to Clipper\\nphone service for someone else\\'s use.\\n\\nCriminals will learn that it is more to their advantage to coerce use of a\\nClipper cellphone than it is to apply a non-Clipper cipher to a normal\\ncellphone.  They will call much less attention to themselves (or at least to\\ntheir stolen phone) this way.  The fact of a phone\\'s use being coerced must\\nfirst be reported before it can be identified as an interesting phone, and\\nhave its keys obtained from escrow.\\n\\nClipper also allows an extraordinary opportunity for the criminal to\\nconceal use of super-encryption.  An automated full-system surveillance\\nmechanism (quite feasible across radio bandwidth) which knows family key F,\\ncan validate Clipper wrappers and N:ESN associations, but it cannot reveal\\nin realtime the use of super-encryption, unless it knows all unit keys,\\nwhich we are being assured are only to be made available in two separate\\npieces, upon specific wiretap-like order.\\n\\nWhereas a criminal\\'s use of any cipher within a normally cleartext medium\\nwould stand out, a criminal\\'s use of a non-Clipper cipher within a Clipper\\nmedium would be very difficult to detect, even ex post facto in bulk\\nrecordings, as long as the association between criminal and specific Clipper\\nchip is fractured.\\n\\nIf you make use of this other cipher illegal per se, then you can charge\\nthe criminal with this (if you can identify the true criminal - he\\'ll be\\nusing someone else\\'s phone), but you\\'ll have no evidence to help you against\\nwhatever traditional crime he might have been planning.  You will not even be\\nable to detect that unusual (encrypted) communications are occurring until you\\nidentify specific phones and obtain their keys from escrow.\\n\\nThe gangster and terrorist are thus arguably more, not less, secure than\\nthey were before Clipper came along.\\n\\nI therefore consider Clipper harmful because:\\n\\n  1.  It does not provide absolute privacy to the honest public against\\n      aggressive or dishonest government.\\n\\n  2.  If other ciphers are proscribed, it engenders new types of direct\\n      criminal threat to the honest public.\\n\\n  3.  It provides an extraordinarily effective mechanism for criminals to\\n      hide their use of some other cipher, making it more difficult than\\n      ever even to gain notice that unusual communications are occurring\\n      and that plans for some criminal act might be in progress.\\n\\n  4.  If other ciphers are proscribed, lazy investigators and prosecutors\\n      are more likely to pursue the easily quantifiable cipher-use crime\\n      than they are the traditional and directly harmful crimes which key\\n      escrow is claimed to help against.\\n\\n  5.  If other ciphers are proscribed, the stage is set for witch hunting\\n      of \"illegal\" cipher use.  Because any computer can be used as a cipher\\n      machine...\\n\\nBrad Yearwood    brad@optilink.com     {uunet, pyramid}!optilink!brad\\nPetaluma, CA\\n' => sci.crypt \n",

El-Awa (American Trust Publications, 1981).\\n> \\n\\nI reiterate that I would agree with you that there is little\\njustification for the punishment of apostasy in the Qur\\'an.\\nIn Islamic history, as well, apostasy has rarely been punished. \\nBelief is considered a matter of conscience and since there\\nis to be no compulsion in the matter of belief, apostates have\\nbeen generally left to believe or not believe as they will.\\n\\nHowever, when an apostate makes attacks upon \"God and\\nHis Messenger\" the situation changes. Now the charge of\\napostasy may be complicated with other charges - perhaps \\ncharges of sedition, treason, spying, etc. If the person \\nmakes a public issue of their apostasy or mounts public\\nattacks (as opposed to arguement) against Islam, the\\nsituation is likewise complicated. If the person spreads\\nslander or broadcasts falsehoods, again the situation\\nchanges. The punishments vary according to the situation\\nthe apostate is in. Anyhow, the charge of aggravated\\napostasy would only be a subsidiary charge in Rushdie\\'s case.\\n\\nThere is a distinction in the Qur\\'an between a formal war situation\\nand being in the situation where someone unilaterally\\nwages war (by their actions), creates disorder, makes mischief,etc. \\nagainst the Muslims and creates a situation that results in harm \\nto Muslims. Here, a small group or even a single individual could\\nbe said to be engaged in such a practise. In other words, there is\\na clear difference between a formal war situation (where two\\nclearly defined parties wage war, conclude treaties, exchange\\nprisoners, etc.), and dealing with attacks that come from isolated\\nindividuals or groups against Islam. It is the second situation, \\nthe unilateral attack and the spreading of \"fasad\" that \\nwould apply in the case of Rushdie.\\n\\nThe matter of Rushdie is not a simple matter of banning an \\noffensive book (banning the book is secondary) -\\na full set of circumstances following the publication of\\nthe book come into play as well, including the deaths of many\\nMuslims, and Rushdie\\'s (and his publishers) Media games.\\n\\n\\n> Now, I do not believe in _blindly_ following anyone, no matter\\n> how knowledgeable he or she may be in Islamic law.

I believe\\nthat one of the Qur\\'anic verses on which the fatwa is based is 5:33.\\nEvery verse in the Qur\\'an has a corresponding \"circumstance of\\nrevelation\" but in no way is the understanding (the tafsir) of the\\nverse restricted solely to the particular historical circumstance\\nin which it was revealed. If this was the case then we could say\\nthat all the laws and regulations that were revealed when the\\nMuslims were NOT involved in conflict, should be suspended when\\nthey were at war. The logic does not follow. In complex, real-life\\nsituations, there may be many verses and many hadiths which can\\nall be related to a single, complicated situation. The internal\\nrelationships between these verses may be quite complex, such that\\narriving at an understanding of how the verses interlock and how\\neach applies to the particular situation can be quite a demanding task.\\nIt is not necessarily a simple \"this or that\" process. There may\\nbe many parameters involved, there may be a larger context in\\nwhich a particular situation should be viewed. All these matters\\nimpinge on the situation.\\n\\nIn other words there is a great deal involved in deciphering the Qur\\'an.\\nThe Qur\\'an asks us to reflect on its verses, but this reflection must\\nentail more than simply reading a verse and its corresponding hadith.\\nIf the reflection is for the sake of increasing personal piety, then each\\nperson has his own level of understanding and there is no harm in that.\\nHowever, if the reflection is in order to decide matters that pertain to\\nthe\\nState, to the gestation of laws and rulings, to the gestation of society,\\nthe dispensing of justice, the guidance of the community, then there \\nare certain minimum requirements of understanding that one \\nshould achieve. Jaffar Ibn Muhammad as-Sadiq(a.s.) relates some of \\nthese requirements, as taught by the Prophet(S.A.), in a hadith:\\n\\n\"...he who does not distinguish in the Book of Allah the abrogating\\nverse from the abrogated one, and a specific one from a general one,\\nand a decisive from an ambiguous; and does not differentiate between\\na permission and an obligation, and does not recognize a verse of\\nMeccan period from a Medinite one, and does not know the circumstances \\nof revelation, and does not understand the technical words of\\nthe Qur\\'an (whether simple or compound); and does not comprehend the\\nknowledge of decree and measure, and is ignorant of advancing and\\ndelaying (in its verses); and does not distinguish the clear from\\nthe deep, nor the manifest from the esoteric, nor the beginning\\nfrom the termination; and is unaware of the question and the answer,\\nthe disjoining and the joining, and the exceptions and the all-inclusive,\\nand is ignorant of an adjective of a preceding noun that explains the\\nsubsequent one; and is unaware of the emphasized subject and the\\ndetailed one, the obligatory laws and the permissions, the places of the\\nduties and rules, and the meaning of the lawful and the unlawful; and\\ndoes not know the joined words, and the words that are related to those\\ncoming before them, or after them - then such a man does not know\\nthe Qur\\'an; nor is he among the people of the Qur\\'an....\".\\n\\nBased on these and other hadiths, and in accordance with many Qur\\'anic\\nverses (\"Why should not a company from every group remain behind \\nto gain profound understanding (tafaqquh) in religion and to warn \\npeople when they return to them, so that they may beware.\" (9:122)),\\na science of jurisprudence arose. The requirements\\nfor a person to be considered a mujtahid (one who can pronounce on\\nmatters of law and religion) are many. I\\'ve listed a few major \\ndivisions below - there are, of course, many subdivisions within these\\nheadings.\\n\\n- Knowledge of Arabic (syntax, conjugation, roots, semantics, oratory).\\n- Knowledge of tafsir and principles of tafsir.\\n- Logic (mantiq)\\n- A knowledge of Hadiths\\n- A knowledge of transmitters (rijal)\\n- Knowledge of the principles of juriprudence (Qur\\'an, Sunnah, Consensus,\\nReasoning)\\n\\nThe study of Qur\\'an and sunnah for purposes of law involves:\\n- discussion of imperatives (awamir)\\n- discussion of negative imperatives (nawahi)\\n- discussion of generalities and particularities (aam wa khas)\\n- discussion of unconditional and conditional\\n- discussion of tacit meanings\\n- discussion of the abstract and the clear\\n- discussion of the abrogator and the abrogated\\n\\nThe principles of Application of the law involves:\\n- principles of exemption\\n- principles of precaution\\n- principles of option\\n- principles of mastery\\n\\nThe jurisprudent is bound to go through a very rigorous process\\nin pronouncing judgement on a given situation. It is not a matter\\nof looking at one verse and one hadith. \\n\\nNow no one should blindly follow anyone, but there is a difference\\nbetween blind following and acceding to the opinion of someone who is\\nclearly more knowledgeable and more qualified than oneself. There is the\\nfamous hadith of the Prophet (S.A.) in which he says:\\n\"The fuqaha (religious scholars) are the trustees of the Prophet, as \\nlong as they do not concern themselves with the illicit desires, pleasures,\\nand wealth of this world.\" The Prophet (S.A.) was asked: \"O Messenger\\nof God! How may we know if they so concern themselves?\" He (S.A.) replied:\\n\"By seeing whether they follow the ruling power. If they do that, fear for\\nyour religion and shun them.\" I do not yet know enough about the Imams\\nof the four Sunni madhabs to comment on how this hadith applies\\nto them or to the contemporary scholars who base themselves upon them.\\n\\nThe Prophet also refered to the fuqaha as \"The fortress of Islam\". My only\\npoint is to make it clear that arriving at a legal judgement calls into\\nplay a certain amount of expertise - the specifics of this expertise is \\ndelineated in the Qur\\'an and hadith. Those who acquire this expertise\\nare praised in both the Qur\\'an and hadith - those who without the requisite\\nknowledge pronounce on matters that affect society, state, and religion \\nare cautioned.\\n\\nThe only reason I said anything at all about the Rushdie affair in this\\ngroup, is because the whole basis for the discussion of the fatwa (that is,\\napostasy), was wrong.

My question is whether that\\nstatement is consistent with Christianity. I would think not.\\n\\nHate begets more hate, never love. Consider some sin. I\\'ll leave it unnamed\\nsince I don\\'t want this to digress into an argument as to whether or not \\nsomething is a sin. Now lets apply our \"hate the sin...\" philosophy and see\\nwhat happens. If we truly hate the sin, then the more we see it, the \\nstronger our hatred of it will become. Eventually this hate becomes so \\nstrong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to hate\\nthe sinner. In addition, our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and \\ndo things which are taken personally by the sinner (who often does not even \\nbelieve what they are doing is a sin). After enough of this, the sinner begins\\nto hate us (they certainly don\\'t love us for our constant criticism of their\\nbehavior). Hate builds up and drives people away from God...this certainly\\ncannot be a good way to build love.\\n\\nIn the summary of the law, Christ commands us to love God and to love our \\nneighbors. He doesn\\'t say anything about hate. In fact, if anything, he \\ncommands us to save our criticisms for ourselves. So, how are Christians\\nsupposed to deal with the sin of others? I suppose that there is only one\\nway to deal with sin (either in others or ourselves)...through prayer. We\\nneed to ask God to help us with our own sin, and to help those we love \\nwith theirs. Only love can conquer sin...hatred has no place. The best way to\\nlove someone is to pray for them. \\n\\n- Scott\\n-- \\nThis is my signature.

But if you can contrive\\n>to control the action in dreams or do an OOBE, it seems like a morality applies.\\n\\nI think that if someone often has immoral dreams, like lustful dreams, \\nor dreams where you commit acts of violence, etc. etc. it may be a sign \\nthat he has something sinful in his heart.  It may be the Holy Spirit's\\nway of allowing the sinfulness that is in us to come to light so that\\nwe can pray about it and have it removed.  Generally, if one has a \\npure heart, and sets his mind on things that are holy, he will be holy\\neven when he dreams.\\n\\nDreams also can be from the Lord.  Joseph and Nebucadnezzar are two examples\\nof people in the Bible who received dreams from the Lord.  \\n\\nRegarding out of body experiences, this is something that we have to be\\ncareful with.  What is called an OOBE can be spiritual in nature, especially\\nif what one saw is the same as an experience witnessed by someone else.\\nChristians should certainly avoid any occult activity that would generate\\nan out of body experience.  Some things that might be called an OOBE\\nmight actually be from the Lord.  Paul wrote of what might of been an OOBE.\\nIn II Corinthians 12, he wrote of a spiritual experience of being caught\\nup into the third heaven.  Is an OOBE truely an OOBE?  Does one really\\nleave his body, or is he just seeing an image being shown to him by a\\nspirit, be it a demon or the Holy Spirit?  I don't think it matters\\nthat much.  Paul could not tell.  \\n\\nBe that as it may, we should be careful not to open ourselves up to Satan\\nto experience OOBE's.  We should not meditate and pretend we are in a \\nplace until our spirits apparently float there.  This is dangerous.  If\\nGod wants to gice us what seems like an OOBE, then He can do that of His\\nown sovereign will.  In the Bible, most often it seems that prophets are\\njust taken up by God's sovereign will, and not because they are seeking\\nan OOBE.  John was in the Spirit praying on the Lord's day when he was\\ncaught up in the visions he received.  Ezekial was talking with some\\nJewish leaders when he was caught up into the visions of God one\\ntime.

Scroggs\\n\\n     Robin Scroggs has built upon the discussion of his predecessors and\\nsuggested a new twist to the word.  Scroggs believes that arsenokoitai is a\\n\"Hellenistic Jewish coinage, perhaps influenced by awareness of rabbinic\\nterminology.\"  The term is derived from Lev 18\"22 & 20:13 where the LXX\\njuxtaposes the two words arsenos (\"male\") and koiten (\"bed\"), and represents\\nthe Hebrew miskab zabar (\"lying with a male\").   Yet he believes that Paul did\\nnot originate the term, but borrowed it from \"circles of Hellenistic Jews\\nacquainted with rabbinic discussions\" (180 n.14).  It was invented to avoid\\n\"contact with the usual Greek terminology\" (108).  If this is true, Scroggs\\nobserves, it explains why the word does not appear in Greco-Roman discussions\\nof pederasty and why later patristic writers avoided it.  It was meaningless to\\nnative-speaking Greeks (108).\\n\\n     Scroggs takes the second part as the active word and the first word as the\\nobject of the second part, thus differing from Boswell\\'s \"learned discussion\"\\n(107).  Yet Scroggs understands the general meaning of \"one who lies with a\\nmale\" to have a very narrow reference.  With the preceding malokoi (I Cor 6:9),\\nwhich Scroggs interprets as \"the effeminate call-boy,\" arsenokoitai is the\\nactive partner \"who keeps the malakos of the \\'mistress\\' or who hires him on\\noccasion to satisfy his sexual desires\" (108).  Hence arsenokoitai does not\\nrefer to homosexuality in general, to female homosexuality, or to the generic\\nmodel of pederasty.  It certainly cannot refer to the modern gay model, he\\naffirms (109).\\n     This is Scrogg\\'s interpretation of the term in I Tim 1:10 also.  The\\ncombination of pornoi (\"fornicators\"), arsenokoitai and andrapodistai (\"slave\\ndealers\") refers to \"male prostitutes, males who lie [with them], and slave\\ndealers [who procure them]\" (120).  It again refers to that  specific form of\\npederasty \"which consisted of the enslaving of boys as youths for sexual\\npurposes, and the use of these boys by adult males\" (121).  Even \"serious\\nminded pagan authors\" condemned this form of pederasty.  He then uses these\\ninstances of arsenokoitai in I Cor and I Tim to interpret the apparently\\ngeneral condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in Rom 1. \\nConsequently Paul \"Must have had, could only have had pederasty in mind\" (122).\\nWe cannot know what Paul would have said about the \"contemporary model of\\nadult/adult mutuality in same sex relation ships\" (122).\\n\\n     In relating these terms to the context and to contemporary ethical\\nconcerns, Scroggs emphasizes the point that the specific items in the list of\\nvices in I Cor 6 have no deliberate, intended meaning in Paul.  The form and\\nfunction of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped.  Any\\nrelationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usually\\nnonexistent.  He concludes that Paul \"does not care about any specific item in\\nthe lists\" (104). \\n\\n     Both on the basis of the meaning of the terms and of the literary\\nphenomenon of a \"catalogue of vices,\"  Scroggs argues that the Scriptures are\\n\"irrelevant and provide no help in the heated debate today\" (129).  The \"model\\nin today\\'s Christian homosexual community is so different from the model\\nattacked by the NT\" that \"Biblical judgments against homosexuality are not\\nrelevant to today\\'s debate.  They should no longer be used in denominational\\ndiscussions about homosexuality, should in no way be a weapon to justify\\nrefusal of ordination. . . \" (127).\\n\\n      REACTIONS TO THE NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI\\n\\nD. Wright\\n\\n     In more recent years the positions of Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs have\\ncome under closer scrutiny.   Perhaps the most critical evaluation of Boswell\\'s\\nview is that by David Wright.  In his thorough article, Wright points out\\nseveral shortcomings of Boswell\\'s treatment of arsenokoitai.   He faults\\nBoswell for failing to cite, or citing inaccurately, all the references to Lev\\n18:22 and 20:13 in the church fathers, such as Eusebius, the \"Apostolic\\nConstitutions,\"  Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian and Origen (127-28). \\nBoswell has not considered seriously enough the possibility that the term\\nderives either its form or its meaning from the Leviticus passages (129).  This\\nis significant, for if the term is so derived, it clearly refutes Boswell\\'s\\nclaim that the first half of the word (arseno-) denotes not the object but the\\ngender of the second half (-koitai).  The LXX must mean \"a male who sleeps with\\na male,\" making arseno- the object.\\n\\n     Wright also faults Boswell\\'s claims regarding linguistic features of the\\nterm, including suggested parallels (129).  Though Boswell claims that\\ncompounds with arseno- employ it objectively and those with arreno- employ it\\nas an adjective, Wright believes that the difference between the two is merely\\none of dialectical diversity: \"No semantic import attaches to the difference\\nbetween the two forms\" (131).  Wright believes that in most compounds in which\\nthe second half is a verb or has a verbal force, the first half denotes its\\nobject and where \"the second part is substantival, the first half denotes its\\ngender\" (132). \\n\\n     It is with Boswell\\'s treatment of the early church fathers that Wright\\ntakes special issue, because the former has failed to cite all the sources. \\nFor example, Aristides\\' Apology (c. AD 138) probably uses arrenomaneis,\\nandrobaten, and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of male\\nhomosexuality (133), contrary to Boswell\\'s discussion.  Boswell fails to cite\\nHippolytus (Refut. Omn. Haer. 5:26:22-23) and improperly cites Eusebius and the\\nSyriac writer Bardensanes.  The latter uses Syriac terms that are identical to\\nthe Syriac of I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 (133-34). \\n\\n     Next Wright shows how the early church fathers use arsenokoitai in\\nparallel with paidophthoria referring to male homosexuality with teenagers, the\\ndominant form of male homosexuality among the Greeks (134).  Sometimes this\\nparallelism occurs in the threefold listings of moicheia (\"adultery\"), porneia\\n(\"fornication\"), and paidophthoria, with arsenokoitai replacing paidophthoris\\n(136).  Clement of Alexandria in Protr. 10:108:5 cites the second table of the\\nTen Commandments as \"You shall not kill, ou moicheuseis (\"you shall not commit\\nadultery\"), ou paidophthoreseis (\"you shall not practice homosexuality with\\nboys\"), you shall not steal. . .\" (150 n. 43).\\n\\n     Another occurrence of arsenokoitein (\"commit homosexuality\") exists in the\\nSibylline Oracles 2:71-73.  It may be, Wright observes, that the word was\\ncoined by a Jewish pre-Christian writer in a Hellenistic setting represented by\\nOr.Sib., book 2 (137-38).\\n\\n     Wright also discusses uses of arsenokoitai in Rhetorius (6th c.) who drew\\nupon the first century AD writer Teucer, in Macarius (4th-5th c.), and in John\\nthe Faster (d. 595) (139-40).  The last in particular bears the idea of\\nhomosexual intercourse, contrary to Boswell.\\n\\n     Wright next replies to Boswell\\'s contention that the term would not be\\nabsent \"from so much literature about homosexuality if that is what it denoted\\n(140-41).  Wright points out that it should not be expected in writers prior to\\nthe first century AD since it did not exist before then, that the Greeks used\\ndozens of words and phrases to refer to homosexuality, that some sources (e.g.\\nDidache) show no acquaintance with Paul\\'s letters or deliberately avoid citing\\nScripture, and that Boswell neglects citing several church fathers (140-41). \\n\\n     Boswell\\'s treatment of Chrysostom in particular draws Wright\\'s attention\\n(141-44).  Boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of Chrysostom,\\nomitting references and asserting what is patently untrue.  Chrysostom gives a\\nlong uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on Rom\\n1:26.  Boswell has exaggerated Chrysostom\\'s infrequent use of the term.  Wright\\nobserves that Boswell has \"signally failed to demonstrate any us of\\narsenokoites etc. in which it patently does not denote male homosexual\\nactivity\" (144).  It is infrequent because of its relatively technical nature\\nand the availability of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearly\\nspecified the prevailing form of male homosexuality in the Greco-Roman world. \\n\\n     Wright also surveys the Latin, Syriac, and Coptic translations of I Tim\\nand I Cor.  All three render arsenokoitai with words that reflect the meaning\\n\"homosexual\" i.e., they understand arseno- as the object of the second half of\\nthe word (144-45).  None of these primary versions supports Boswell\\'s limited\\nconclusion based on them.\\n\\n     Wright concludes his discussion with a few observations about the\\ncatalogues of vices as a literary form.  He believes that such lists developed\\nin late Judaism as Hellenistic Jews wrote in clear condemnation of\\nhomosexuality in the Greek world.  This paralleled the increased concern on the\\npart of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence.  The term came into\\nbeing under the influence of the LXX (145) so that writers spoke \"generally of\\nmale activity with males rather than specifically categorized male sexual\\nengagement with paides\" (146).  If arsenokoitai and paidophthoria were\\ninterchangeable, it is because the former encompassed the latter (146).\\n\\n     In summary, Wright seeks to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term meaning\\nhomosexuality and arises with Judaism.   The views of Boswell, Scroggs, and\\nothers who limit the term to \"active male prostitutes\" or pederasty are without\\nsignificant support from linguistic and historical studies.  \\n\\n[Next: the questioning of Wrights position by William Peterson.  After that, we\\nget into the \"good\" stuff of historical & linguistic studies.  THis will\\ninclude \"Symposium\" by Plato.  If there is any doubt as to the modern\\nunderstanding of homosexuality being understood or contemmplated at the time of\\nPaul, this will certainly clear things up.  Also we will review Paul\\'s use of\\nLev18-20 in the NT and how, as for him, 1) the Law was fulfilled, but not done\\naway with, 2) Lev 18-20 was the universal and the following chapters the\\ngeneral.  Those who put forth that the OT no longer holds true today in our\\nculture, should stick around for this one.]\\n___________________________\\n13 R. Scroggs, THe New Testament and Homosexuality (Phil: 1983) 86, 107-8. \\nIndependently we came to the same conclusion.  Apparently the connection is\\nmade in E.A. Sophocles, Greek Lexicon of the Roman & Byzantine Periods (from\\n146BC to AD 1100).\\n14   See discussion, 101-4.  He says the same thing about Paul\\'s language in\\nRom 1:26-27 (128).  But this is doubtful.  See the more cautious words of P.\\nZaas, \"I Cor 6.9ff: Was Homosexuality Condoned in the Corinthian Church? SBLASP\\n17 (1979):205-12.  He observes that the words moixai, malakoi, and arsenokoitai\\nwere part of Jewish anti-Gentile polemic.  Yet Paul\\'s wors at the end of the\\nvice list, \"and such were some of you,\" indicate that \"Paul is addressing real\\nor potential abuses of his ethical message, not citing primitive tradition by\\nrote\" (210).  Wright disputes Zaas\\' attempt to associate the term with idolatry\\n(147).\\n15  On Boswell\\'s treatment of Rom 1:26-7, the article by R.B. Hays, \"Relations\\nNatural and Unnatural\"  A Response to John Boswell\\'s Exegesis of Romans 1,\" JRE\\n14/1 (Spring 1986): 184-215, is an excellent critique.\\n16  D.F. Wright, \"Homosexuals or Prostitutes?  The Meaning of ARSENOKOITAI (I\\nCor 6:9, I Tim 1:10), VC 38 (1984):125-53.\\n17  In an unpublished paper, Henry Mendell, \"ARSENOKOITAI: Boswell on Paul,\"\\neffectively refutres Boswell\\'s claims regarding the philology of arsenokoitai. \\nHe finds the meaning to be general, \"a male who has sex with a male\" (4-11).  \\n18  Wright\\'s endnotes (148-49) list additional sources in the church fathers.\\n19   We also have noticed the same tendency by Boswell to fail to cite all the\\nreferences to Sodom and sodomy in the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha.  See  J.B.\\nDeYoung, \"A Critique of Prohomosexual Interpretations of the OT Apocrypha and\\nPseudepigrapha,\" BSac 146/588 (1990):437-53.\\n20   In light of the claim made by Boswell that the infrequency of arsenokoitai\\npoints to a meaning lacking homosexual significance, Wright asks pertinently\\n\"why neither Philo nor Josephus use  paidofthoria, nor Josephus paiderastia,\\nand why . . Clement did not use the latter and Chrysostom the former?\"  (152 n.\\n71)  In a more recent article, \"Homosexuality: The Relevance of the Bible,\" EvQ\\n61 (1989):291-300, Wright reiterates these same points.  Paul shows a\\n\"remarkable originality\" in extending the OT ethic to the church (300).\\n\\n \\n' => soc.religion.christian \n",

I for one am glad to see this happen, and hope more\\n>umpires will do as Hirschbeck did in instructing the pitcher to pitch if\\n>the batter won\\'t get back in the box.  \\n\\nWhile I can see why they want to cut down on the time spent walking around,\\nGant wasn\\'t ordered back in the box \"sooner\", he was ordered back immediately.\\nAs soon as he stepped out, Hirschbeck told him to get back in the box.\\nNow, Gant doesn\\'t take a lot of walks between pitches.  The only reason\\nhe did then because he was *very* bothered by the call.  I expect his\\nconcentration wasn\\'t there yet, and in a crucial situation I imagine it\\'s\\nbest to be as calm as possible.  Contributing factors would be Gant\\'s\\nbad day at the plate, bad year at the plate, and the Braves long scoring\\ndrought.\\n\\nNow, it\\'s pretty stupid to go ahead and talk the walk when the umpire is\\ntelling you to get in there.  You know the umpire is going to do something\\n(call for a strike, throw you out, etc.).  Gant was wrong.\\n\\nBut Hirschbeck was more wrong, in my biased view.  Aside from the major chip\\nhe seemed to have on his shoulder, what was the problem.  Gant had a reason\\nto want some time (disputed strike call).  Gant hadn\\'t been wasting time all\\ngame.  The game had been cruising along, and was just over two hours old.\\nThe score was 1-0, with 2 outs in the ninth and a runner in scoring position.\\nIs there *any* reason Hirschbeck couldn\\'t, and shouldn\\'t, cut Gant a little\\nslack?  For no discernible constructive reason, Hirschbeck disrupted the\\ngame, caused a five minute delay, and materially hurt the batter in a key\\nsituation.  Did he have a date to get to?\\n\\nAnd I still wonder why Terry was tossed earlier in the game.\\n-- \\nDale J.

This\\nmeans that some simulation of the ears coloring of sound relative to it\\'s\\nincoming direction have to be done for each sound source.  (I think this is\\npossible to do with a lookup table of impulse responses for several angles\\nrelative to each ear, and interpolate an impulse function from this for a given\\nangle.  This impulse function could then be convoluted with the sound from the\\nsource.  This impulse function must be changed every time some sound source\\nchanges position or the listener changes orientation.)  Additionally some\\nreflection, diffusion and absorbtion due to the environment wich is defined\\ncould be simulated, but this requires some sort of sound propagandation\\nsimulation, kinda like some radiosity algorithm.  \\n\\nHave someone done this and/or written articles on implementing such a system? \\n\\nPlease post or mail any answers or comments.\\n\\n-- \\nTorgeir Veimo\\n\\nStudying at the University of Bergen\\n\\n\"...I\\'m gona wave my freak flag high!\" (Jimi Hendrix)\\n\\n\"...and it would be okay on any other day!\" (The Police)\\n\\n' => comp.sys.mac.hardware \n",

To accomodate AIX version 3.2, we have created a patch to\\nthe sources.  The patch and accompanying instructions for its\\napplication can be retrieved at no charge via anonymous-ftp from the\\ninternet host emsworth.andrew.cmu.edu (128.2.45.40) in the directory\\n./aixpatch.  For those without internet access, a 3.5\" diskette can be\\nordered for $10 by sending, or faxing, a purchase order to the address\\nbelow. \\n\\nThe base 5.1 system can be ordered from us as a CDrom or ftp\\'ed from the\\nsame host.\\n\\nNote that this patch adds no additional functionality but simply allows\\nAUIS to compile under AIX3.2.\\n\\n-----------\\n\\nThe Andrew User Interface System (AUIS) is a comprehensive environment\\non top of X11 windows in which you can create, use, and mail multi-media\\napplications and documents.   A major advantage of AUIS is the\\ncapability to recursively embed objects.  Thus, one can edit text that\\nnot only contains multiple fonts, indentation, and other typography, but\\nalso  contains embedded raster images, spreadsheets, drawing editors,\\nequations, simple animations, and so on. These embedded objects can\\nthemselves contain other objects, including text.\\n\\nAUIS has three components:\\n\\n    The Andrew User Environment is an integrated and extensible set\\n    of applications beginning with the ez text editor, a help\\n    system, a system monitoring tool, an editor-based shell\\n    interface, and other editors corresponding to the various\\n    available types of objects. \\n\\n    The Andrew Toolkit (ATK) is a portable, object-oriented\\n    user-interface toolkit that provides the architecture wherein\\n    objects can be embedded in one-another.  With the toolkit,\\n    programmers can create new objects that can be embedded as\\n    easily as those that come with the system. \\n\\n    The Andrew Message System (AMS) provides a multi-media interface\\n    to mail and bulletin-boards.  AMS supports several mail\\n    management strategies and implements many advanced  features\\n    including authentication, return receipts, automatic sorting of\\n    mail, vote collection and tabulation, enclosures, audit trails\\n    of related messages, and subscription management. It also\\n    provides a variety of interfaces that support ttys and\\n    low-function personal computers in addition to high-function\\n    workstations. \\n\\nThe current public release of Andrew, Version 5.1,  includes support for\\nthe new Internet MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) standards\\nfor multipart, multimedia mail.  A newer release, 5.2, for members of\\nthe Andrew Consortium has numerous additional features including new\\neditors for drawings, images, fonts, and user preferences.\\n\\n\\nRemote Andrew Demo Service\\n\\nYou can try out Andrew from your own work station via the Remote Andrew\\nDemo Service.  You need a host machine on the Internet running the X11\\nwindow system.  You\\'ll be able to compose multimedia documents, navigate\\nthrough the interactive Andrew Tour, and use the Andrew Message System\\nto browse through a few of CMU\\'s four thousand bulletin boards and\\nnewsgroups.\\n\\nTo get started with the Remote Andrew Demo service, simply run the\\nfollowing command on your machine:\\n\\n\\tfinger help@atk.itc.cmu.edu\\n\\nThe service will give you further instructions.   \\n\\n\\nMore information about Andrew is available from:\\n\\n    Information Requests\\n    Andrew Consortium\\n    Carnegie Mellon University\\n    Smith Hall 106\\n    5000 Forbes Avenue\\n    Pittsburgh, PA 15213-3890\\n    USA\\n    phone: +1-412-268-6710\\n    fax: +1-412-682-6938\\n    info-andrew-request@andrew.cmu.edu\\n\\nContact info-andrew-request@andrew.cmu.edu for additional information.  \\n\\n' => comp.windows.x \n",

EDT\\n\\t     \\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  On February the 28th, four federal \\nagents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law \\nagainst the Branch Davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiled \\nweaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk.  \\nBecause the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day \\nstandoff ensued.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every \\nreasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without \\nbloodshed and further loss of life.  The Bureau's efforts were \\nultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were \\ndealing, David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probably \\ninsane.      \\n\\n\\t     He engaged in numerous activities which violated both \\nfederal law and common standards of decency.  He was, moreover, \\nresponsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the \\naction against the compound in February.  Given his inclination \\ntowards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, no \\nprovocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal \\nagents against the compound.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on \\nan operation prepared by the FBI, designed to increase pressure on \\nKoresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully.  \\nThe plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, even \\nin the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not cause \\npermanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the people \\nin the compound to come outside and to surrender.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I was informed of the plan to end the siege.  I \\ndiscussed it with Attorney General Reno.  I asked the questions I \\nthought it was appropriate for me to ask.  I then told her to do what \\nshe thought was right, and I take full responsibility for the \\nimplementation of the decision.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy.  \\nMr. Koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federal \\nagents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his \\ncaptives, as well as all the other people who were there who did not \\nsurvive.  He killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimate \\nresponsibility for the carnage that ensued.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Now we must review the past with an eye towards the \\nfuture.  I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and \\nTreasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to \\nuncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have been \\ndone differently.  I have told the departments to involve independent \\nprofessional law enforcement officials in the investigation.  I \\nexpect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required \\nto complete the review.  Finally, I have directed the departments to \\ncooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can \\ncontinue to be fully accountable to the American people.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney \\nGeneral, to the Justice Department, and to the federal agents on the \\nfront lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult \\ncircumstances.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Again, I want to say as I did yesterday, I am very sorry \\nfor the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end \\nof this tragedy in Waco.  I hope very much that others who will be \\ntempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David \\nKoresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over \\nthe last seven weeks.  And I hope very much that the difficult \\nsituations which federal agents confronted there and which they will \\nbe doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future \\nwill be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what \\nhas been learned now.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, can you, first of all, tell us why, \\nafter 51 days, you decided --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, can you describe for us what it is \\nthat Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation \\nwith --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I can't hear you both.  If one will go \\nfirst and then the other.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Sorry.  Can you describe what Janet Reno --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll answer both your questions, but I \\ncan't do it at once.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about \\nthe nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was told by the Attorney General \\nthat the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another \\nstep in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  And she \\ndescribed generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted \\nto go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause \\npermanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it \\nvery difficult for people to stay inside the building.  And it was \\nhoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I was further told that under no circumstances would our \\npeople fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  They were going to \\nshoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and \\nthere would be no exchange of fire.  In fact, as you know, an awful \\nlot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials.  \\nThere were no shots coming back from the government side.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I asked a number of questions.  The first question I \\nasked is, why now?  We have waited seven weeks; why now?  The reasons \\nI was given were the following:\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Number one, that there was a limit to how long the \\nfederal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the \\nquality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might be \\nneeded in other parts of the country.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Number two, that the people who had reviewed this had \\nnever seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced \\nthat no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to \\nbe made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult \\nmembers to come out.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Number three, that the danger of their doing something \\nto themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with \\nthe passage of time.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And number four, that they had reason to believe that \\nthe children who were still inside the compound were being abused \\nsignificantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and \\nunsafe conditions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time.  \\nThe second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had \\ngiven consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and \\nevaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She said \\nthat the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were \\nconvinced that the chances of bad things happening would only \\nincrease with the passage of time.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The third question I asked was, has the military been \\nconsulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco, \\nthat's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious \\nthat this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Military \\npeople were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some \\nof the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if the \\nmilitary had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that they \\nhad, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one \\nminor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military \\n-- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming \\nsignificance.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, I \\nsaid that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she \\nshould proceed and that I would support it.  And I stand by that \\ntoday.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Go ahead.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you address the widespread perception --\\nreported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were \\ntrying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I'm bewildered by it.  The only \\nreason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only \\nreason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to \\nadd to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather \\nlate in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who \\nhad been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into \\ncustody.  It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events \\nto unfold.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     There was -- I have -- I can't account for why people \\nspeculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney General \\non the day before the action took place.  I talked to her yesterday.  \\nI called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry \\nKing Show, and I talked to her again this morning.  A President -- it \\nis not possible for a President to distance himself from things that \\nhappen when the federal government is in control.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I will say this, however.  I was, frankly, surprised \\nwould be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the \\nAttorney General should resign because some religious fanatics \\nmurdered themselves.  (Applause.)  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I regret what happened, but it is not possible in this \\nlife to control the behavior of others in every circumstance.  These \\npeople killed four federal officials in the line of duty.  They were \\nheavily armed.  They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly, \\nand they were never fired back on.  We did everything we could to \\navoid the loss of life.  They made the decision to immolate \\nthemselves.  And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about the \\nchildren.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno, \\nis when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want you \\nto tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why \\nyou believe we should move now rather than wait some more.  And she \\nsaid, it's because of the children.  They have evidence that those \\nchildren are still being abused and that they're in increasingly \\nunsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easier \\nwith time -- with the passage of time.  I have to take their word for \\nthat.  So that is where I think things stand.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can we assume then that you don't think this was \\nmishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out of \\npatience?  And if you had it to do over again, would you really \\ndecide that way?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No -- well, I think what you can assume \\nis just exactly what I announced today.  This is a -- the FBI has \\ndone a lot of things right for this country over a long period of \\ntime.  This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the \\nWorld Trade Center in lickety-split, record time.  We want an inquiry \\nto analyze the steps along the way.  Is there something else we \\nshould have known?  Is there some other question they should have \\nasked?  Is there some other question I should have asked?  Can I say \\nfor sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make \\nthe outcome come different?  I don't know that.  That's why I want \\nthe inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we have \\nsome independent law enforcement people, not political people, but \\ntotally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the best \\nevidence we have.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     There is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort of \\nfanaticism all across the world.  And we may have to confront it \\nagain.  And I want to know whether there is anything we can do, \\nparticularly when there are children involved.  But I do think it is \\nimportant to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the \\npeople who killed others and then killed themselves.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, were there any other options \\npresented to you for resolving this situation at any point from \\nFebruary 28th until yesterday?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, yes, I got regular reports all \\nalong the way.  There were lots of other options pursued.  If you go \\nback -- you all covered it very well.  The FBI -- you did a very good \\njob of it.  I mean, the FBI and the other authorities there pursued \\nany number of other options all along the way, and a lot of them \\nearly on seemed to be working.  Some of the children got out, some of \\nthe other people left.  There was a -- at one point, there seemed to \\nbe some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the \\nauthorities.  And then he would say things and not do them and things \\njust began to spin downward.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Whether there were other -- in terms of what happened \\nyesterday, the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not \\ninvolve other options except whether we should take more time with \\nthe present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they \\nwanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to get \\npeople out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves.  \\nThat's what they thought.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did the government know that the children did not \\nhave gas masks?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     congressional hearings once the situation -- are \\nyou in agreement with that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  That's up to the Congress.  They can do \\nwhatever they want.  But I think it's very important that the \\nTreasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring \\nin some outside experts.  And as I said in my statement, if any \\ncongressional committees want to look into it, we will fully \\ncooperate.  There is nothing to hide here.  This was probably the \\nmost well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the \\ncountry.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Go ahead, Sarah.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  There are two questions I want to ask you.  The \\nfirst is, I think that they knew very well that the children did not \\nhave gas masks while the adults did, so the children had no chance \\nbecause this gas was very -- she said it was not lethal, but it was \\nvery dangerous to the children and they could not have survived \\nwithout gas masks.  And on February 28th -- let's go back -- didn't \\nthose people have a right to practice their religion?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  They were not just practicing their \\nreligion, they were -- the Treasury Department believed that they had \\nviolated federal laws, any number of them.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What federal laws --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me go back and answer -- I can't \\nanswer the question about the gas masks, except to tell you that the \\nwhole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested; they \\nwere convinced that it wouldn't kill either a child or an adult but \\nit would force anybody that breathed it to run outside.  And one of \\nthe things that I've heard -- I don't want to get into the details of \\nthis because I don't know -- but one of the things that they were \\nspeculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that \\nthe windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have \\nescaped and that may be why it didn't have the desired effect.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     They also knew, Sarah, that there was an underground \\ncompound -- a bus buried underground where the children could be \\nsent.  And they were -- I think they were hoping very much that if \\nthe children were not released immediately outside that the humane \\nthing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace \\nwhere they could be protected.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     In terms of the gas masks themselves, I learned \\nyesterday -- I did not ask this fact question before -- that the gas \\nwas supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks \\nthemselves were to work.  So that it was thought that even if they \\nall had gas masks, that eventually the gas would force them out in a \\nnonviolent, nonshooting circumstance.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Last question.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, why are you still saying that --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Could you tell us whether or not you ever asked \\nJanet Reno about the possibility of a mass suicide?  And when you \\nlearned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your \\nmind during those horrendous moments?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  What I asked Janet Reno is if they had \\nconsidered all the worse things that could happen.  And she said --\\nand, of course, the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the \\npublic -- he had -- that had been debated anyway.  And she said that \\nthe people who were most knowledgeable  about these kinds of issues \\nconcluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would \\nbe tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in \\nthe future.  That was the judgment they made.  Whether they were \\nright or wrong, of course, we will never know. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     What happened when I saw the fire, when I saw the \\nbuilding burning?  I was sick.  I felt terrible.  And my immediate \\nconcern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were \\nescaping or whether they were inside, trying to burn themselves up.  \\nThat's the first thing I wanted to know.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Thank you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, why are you still saying it was a \\nJanet Reno decision?  Isn't it, in the end, your decision?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I'm saying is that I didn't \\nhave a four- or five-hour, detailed briefing from the FBI.  I didn't \\ngo over every strategic part of it.  It is a decision for which I \\ntake responsibility.  I'm the President of the United States and I \\nsigned off on the general decision and giving her the authority to \\nmake the last call.  When I talked to her on Sunday, some time had \\nelapsed.  She might have made a decision to change her mind.  I said, \\nif you decide to go forward with this tomorrow, I will support you. \\nAnd I do support her.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     She is not ultimately responsible to the American \\npeople; I am.  But I think she has conducted her duties in an \\nappropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation I think as \\nwell as she could have.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Thank you.

I realize it is \\n> normally tossed out because it contains miracles, but what\\n> are the other reasons?\\n\\nFar from being \"tossed out,\" the gospels are taken, almost\\nuniversally, as the primary source of information about Jesus.\\nI am curious as to whom Mike Cobb is referring.  Who \"tosses out\"\\nthe New Testament?  Undoubtedly a few *naive* atheists do this,\\nbut the phrasing of the question above seems to suggest that Cobb\\nascribes this more broadly.\\n\\nPerhaps the question that gets more to the heart of the matter is\\nwhy, except for some *naive* believers (who, unfortunately, far\\noutnumber nonbelievers, both naive and critical), are the gospels\\n*not* taken as \"gospel truth\" that faithfully records just what\\nhappened two thousand years ago?  This has an easy answer, and\\nthe answer has *nothing* to do with miracles: no text is taken\\nthis way by a critical reader.\\n\\nThere is a myth among some naive believers that one takes a text,\\nmeasures it by some set of criteria, and then either confirms the\\ntext as \"historically valid\" or \"tosses out\" the text.  I suspect\\nthis myth comes from the way history is presented in primary and\\nsecondary school, where certain texts are vested with authority,\\nand from writers such as Josh McDowell who pretend to present\\nhistorical arguments along these lines for their religious\\nprogram.  In fact, most texts used in primary and secondary\\nschool history classes ought to be tossed out, even the better\\nsuch texts should not be treated as authoritatively as descibed\\nabove, and Josh McDowell would not know a historical argument if\\nit bit him on the keister twice.\\n\\nLet me present the barest outlines of a different view of texts\\nand their use in studying history.  First, all texts are\\nhistorically valid.  ALL texts.  Or to put this another way, I\\nhave never seen a notion of \"historical validity\" that makes any\\nsense when applied to a text.  Second, no text should be read as\\ntelling the \"gospel truth\" about historical events, in the way\\nthat many students are wont to read history texts in primary and\\nsecondary school.  NO text.  (This includes your favorite\\nauthor\\'s history of whatever.)\\n\\nEvery text is a historical fact.  Every text was written by some\\nperson (or some group of people) for some purpose.  Hence, every\\ntext can serve as historical evidence.  The question is: what can\\nwe learn from a text?  Of what interesting things (if any) does\\nthe text provide evidence?\\n\\nThe diaries of the followers of the Maharishi, formerly of\\nOregon, are historical evidence.  The gospels are historical\\nevidence.  The letters of the officers who participated in the \\nvampire inquests in Eastern Europe are historical evidence.  The\\nmodern American history textbooks that whitewash \"great American\\nfigures\" are historical evidence.  These are all historical\\nevidence of various things.  They are *not* much evidence at all\\nthat the Maharishi, formerly of Oregon, could levitate; that\\nJesus was resurrected; that vampires exist; or that \"great\\nAmerican figures\" are as squeaky clean as we learned in school.\\nThey are better evidence that some people \"saw\" the Maharishi,\\nlate of Oregon, levitate; that some of the early Christians\\nthought Jesus was resurrected; that many people in Eastern Europe\\n\"saw\" vampires return from the grave; and that we still have an\\neducational system that largely prefers to spread myth rather\\nthan teach history.\\n\\nHow does one draw causal connections and infer what a piece of\\nhistorical evidence -- text or otherwise -- evinces?  This is a\\nvery complex question that has no easily summarized answer.\\nThere are many books on the subject or various parts of the\\nsubject.  I enjoy David Hackett Fischer\\'s \"Historian\\'s Fallacies\"\\nas a good antidote to the uncritical way in which it is so easy\\nto read texts present history.  It\\'s relatively cheap.

They resort to literary types and display an artificiality of\\nsubject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred Scripture.\\n4.

The Jewish council you mentioned previously didn\\'t\\naccept them, so the reformation protestants had good historical\\nprecedence for their actions.

I have faith that it will be a fine product, more desireable\\nthan the Camaro is now.  You know, that\\'s MHO.  \\n\\nThe differences these days between Ford and GM are not so much the quality,\\njust the philosophy.  It used to be quality _and_ philosophy.  GM is\\nbarely catching up, but they have more room for improvement that\\ncan only be made up in time.  STSs still come off the assembly line\\nwith screwed up paint stripes and poor trunk/door/hood/panel alignments;\\nit\\'s those 75 year old plants.  And the latest GM products still come\\nwith the standard equipment RattleDash (tm).  But like I said, they\\'re\\ngetting better and making the move in the right direction.\\n\\nThey beat Ford to the market with the Camaro/Firebird, but really only\\nin words.  Production of these vehicles will be limited until the\\nend of the year, keeping selling prices above MSRP for the most part\\nsince there are so many twitching Camaro fans out there.  I wouldn\\'t\\npress Ford to hurry the Mustang since the final wait could be worth it.\\nBesides, no bow-tie fanatic is gonna buy the Mustang anyway.\\n\\nI do not put much stock in the mag rags\\' \"inside\" information, or even\\nFord rep quotes.  The Taurus was pretty much a surprise when it was\\nfinally disclosed in it\\'s entirety.  \"Inside\" information had the\\nTaurus with a V8 and rear-wheel drive at one point.  I wouldn\\'t look\\nfor a simple re-paneled Mustang, folks; you may be cheating yourself\\nif you do.  There\\'s a lot of potential.  Ford hasn\\'t released a new\\ncar without a 4-wheel IS in 7 years.  The Mustang project has been\\nbrewing for at least 4, right?  A 4-wheel IS could happen.  Those\\nmodular V8\\'s are out there, too.  In the interest of CAFE and\\ncompetition, don\\'t rule those out, either.   Your ignorant if you do.\\nAnd there are so many spy shots and artist renderings out there,\\nwho really knows what it\\'ll look like?  The Mach III?  Doubt it.\\nHighly.\\n\\nThe next Mustang will be Ford\\'s highest profile car.  It attracts\\nway more attention than the Camaro/Firebird because it\\'s heritage\\nis more embedded in the general public.  Don\\'t lie to yourself and\\nbelieve Ford will forfeit that.\\n\\nI submit that the Mustang will be a success.  Enough to elicit\\ndefensive remarks from some heavy Camaro fans here.  You know,\\nintelligent, critical spews like, \"The Mustang bites, man!\"  Some of\\nyou are already beginning.  I predict that the Mustang and Camaro\\nwill be comparable performers, as usual.  I predict that the\\ndifferences will be in subjective areas like looks and feel, as usual.\\nThe Camaro is still a huge automobile; the Mustang will retain its\\ncab-rearward styling and short, pony-car wheelbase.  The Camaro still\\nreaches out to the fighter pilot, while the Mustang will appeal to\\nthe driver.  The Camaro will still sell to the muscle car set, while\\nthe Mustang will continue to sell to the college-degreed muscle car set.\\nBoth will be more refined (I do think the Camaro is).  There will be\\nno clear winner.\\n\\nUnless the Ford gets the 32v, 300hp Romeo.

I think\\nit was also shown during the Calgary-LA game. \\n\\n(Warning... Anti-fighting people may want to skip this post.)\\n\\nTopics\\n------\\n\\nDon\\'s Tie, Doug Gilmour, Wings/Leafs, Quebec/Montreal, Boston/Buffalo,\\nWendel Clark, Fighting and Stickwork.\\n\\nEpisode Summary\\n---------------\\n\\nOnce again, the episode started with a shot of Don\\'s tie... This\\nwas a different tie than last time. Don pointed out some of the\\ncharacters on the tie, but gave them different names... Felix the\\nCat (Sylverster), Maclean (Daffy Duck), etc.\\n\\nRon Maclean asked Don what he thought of the current Wings-Leafs\\ngame. Don thought it was good. Burns told the Leaf players \"They\\nwon in their building, we\\'re going to win in ours\".\\n\\nDon then began to praise Gilmour again. Don pointed out that Gilmour\\nhas never got less than 2 points or a goal in any game since he\\ngot 5 points in a game against St. Louis.  (Don also claims that\\nhe gave a lot of encouragement to Gilmour, which was partly responsible\\nfor his good play.) Several clips were then shown of Gilmour\\nfrom the series... A hit on Constantinov, and a pass to Andrewchuk\\nresulting in a goal.\\n\\nOn the game itself, the Wings were taking a lot of penalties in\\nthe first period. The Wings have enough talent to score short handed\\nhowever, and when the Leafs get a power play, Coach Burns tells\\nthe Leaf players \"Don\\'t let them score on you\".\\n\\nRon brought up the previous Quebec-Montreal game. [Note: Montreal\\nwon that game in overtime, despite having a possible game winner\\ndisqualified because it was batted in with a high stick.] Don\\nthought the high stick was obvious, even without the use of\\ninstant replay.\\n\\nOn the Buffalo-Boston series [Note: Buffalo is currently winning\\nthe series 3-0], Don gave full credit to Goaltender Grant Fuhr.\\nFuhr should be getting 1/2 the team\\'s playoff checks for his\\nplay.\\n\\nWendel Clarke has recently been criticized for his performance\\nduring the Detroit-Toronto series. Don defended him, by saying\\nthat he can\\'t play the way he should, because of the league\\'s\\nnew rules. \"This used to be a rough and tough league... Now its\\nall hack and slash.\" Don lays the blame on Gil Stien for the\\nproblems.\\n\\nDon\\'s opinions on fighting and stickwork are shared by Wings\\nGM and coach Bryan Murray. A clip from a news conference by Murray\\nwas shown, in which Murray made statements claiming the elimination\\nof fighting increases stickwork. Don also read a newspaper article\\nin which Murray makes the following statements: \"Players don\\'t fight\\nbecause they\\'re afraid of getting thrown out of the game as instigator.\\nInstead, they settle grudges by getting their sticks and slicing\\neach other. Is this what the fans want to see? I guarantee there\\nwouldn\\'t be as many slashes if fighting were kept in the game.\"\\n\\nDon warned league commisioner Gary Bettman to \"smarten up\" with\\nfighting in hockey. He went on to say that before, there used\\nto be one guy cut with a high stick in a series. Now, with no fights,\\nsomeone gets cut every period.\\n\\nRating\\n------\\nTypical anti-fighting posturing, but here Don\\'s opinion is supported\\nby Murray.\\n\\nI\\'d give it a 7.0 out of 10.\\n' => rec.sport.hockey \n",

It was known to the Syrians as Armenia and to the Arabs\\nas Ermeniyye.\\n \\nOthers believe that Urartu was known in the time of the Medes as \\'Harminap\\'\\nwhich was later modified by the Persians to \\'Arminia\\'. \\'Ar\\' refers to a\\nplace, as in Ararat, Archish, Aruyr, Archar, Arshav, Arazen and Aror, \\nwhile \\'men\\' is used to refer to spirit, thought or human being, and \\ntherefore \\'Armen\\' would appear to signify \\'the people of that place\\'.\\n\\nG. Alishan believes that \\'according to our national vocabulary \"Haik\"\\nis the diminutive form of \"Hai\", and that \"Hai\" is the name of our\\nnation. Our nation is in no way connected with the word \"Armen\" that\\nforeigners apply to our people.\\'\\n\\nIt would thus appear that \\'Armenia\\' is a place-name, that \\'Armen\\' is \\nthe name of the people who lived there, and that these are in no way\\nconnected with the word \\'Hai\\'.\\n\\nHaik and Haiastan:\\n\\nArmenian historians believe Haik to have been a great hero from whom\\nthe Armenian people took the name \\'Hai\\'. But the mere resemblance\\nbetween the words \\'Haik\\' and \\'Hai\\' constitutes no real proof, and,\\nin any case, no such theory appears before the time of Moses of\\nKhoren.\\n\\nHaiasa:\\n\\nThe following studies show quite clearly that \\'Hai\\' and \\'Haiasa\\' were\\nno more than general names used by the Hittites to refer to the \\nregion known as Armenia.\\n\\nProfessor Hachadurian: \\'Haiasa was the general name used in Hittite\\ninscriptions for Upper Armenia.\\'\\n\\nYensen, in his \\'Hittites and Armenians\\' tries to prove that \\'Hai\\' is\\nidentical with the Hittite \\'Hatio\\', in other words that \\'Hai\\' is a\\nHittite word. Research, however, has proved this erroneous, and shown\\nthat \\'Hai\\' was derived from \\'Hatio\\'.\\n\\nMortman\\'s attempt to read the Urartu inscriptions as Armenian met with \\nno success. As for Greek, there is no point in even mentioning it.\\n\\nThe resemblance between the words \\'Haiasa\\' and \\'Haiastan\\' is so obvious\\nthat we may well accept \\'Haiasa\\' as the oldest form of \\'Haiastan\\'.\\n\\nLet us now cast a brief glance on how the words \\'Hai\\', \\'Haikazan\\' and\\n\\'Haiastan\\' entered our older works.\\n\\nAccording to Karakashian: \\n\\n\\'The word \"Haik\" is never to be found employed with reference to a\\nleader of the Armenian people prior to Moses of Khoren, nor is it\\never found employed in the forms \"Haika\" or \"Haykazn\".\\n\\nAgahangelos and Puzant use the word as a title or a place-name (he\\nimproved and developed Haiastan, etc.). If the word had referred\\nto a nation and had been derived from \"Hai\" or \"Haik\" they could \\nalso have used the words \"Haikak\" and \"Haykazn\" in a number of\\nplaces.\\'\\n\\nAccording to Professor Sayce, who deciphered a number of Hittite \\ninscriptions:\\n\\n\\'In the Hittite language the suffix -ha is used to specify quality\\nor species. The words \"Haddanas\", \"Haddina\" were used by the \\nAssyrians to refer to the Hittites. With the transformation of the\\n\"d\" between the two \"a\" letters to \"y\" \"Hadinasdani\" was in this\\nway transformed to \"Haiastan\"\\'.\\n\\nProfessor Grechmer fully agrees with this point of view, but regards\\nthe significance and explanation so far accorded to the terms \\'Hai\\'\\nand \\'Haistan\\' as quite unsatisfactory. He finds, however, that a \\nsolution to this problem is brought nearer by the name \\'Haiasa\\' \\nwhich is so frequently found in Bogazkoy from 1400 B.C. onwards.\\nForrer takes \\'Haiasa\\' as referring to Upper Armenia. In that case\\nit seems likely that \\'Haiasa\\' was actually a part of Armenia. The\\nsuffix -dan is of Anatolian origin. The real root is \\'Hayasa\\', which\\nrefers to the country of the \\'Hayasas\\'.\\n\\nE. Chantre writes as follows on the subject of the ethnological \\nand Anthropological characteristics of the Armenian people.\\n\\nThe Armenians in Russia may be characterized as follows: Almost\\nall of them are brachycephalic or leptocephalic, very dark,\\nabove average height, an Aissores Asian group with close ties\\nwith certain Kurdish tribes and Azerbaijan peoples.\\n\\nAccording to J. Deniker:\\n\\nFrom the philological point of view, the Armenian and Kurds may be\\nregarded as belonging to the Iranian group...The Armenians are \\ndescended from various elements and from a very mixed race. Their\\naverage height varies between 1.63 and 1.69 according to the region.\\nThey are almost always short-headed, with skull measurements of \\n85-87. As a race they belong to the Indo-Afghan-Assyrian-Turkic\\nfamily.\\n\\nProfessor Rene Vernont writes as follows:\\n\\nThe Armenians are a mixture of Semites, Turk, Kurds and Mongols,\\nbut some of them display Armenian features, e.g., height a little\\nabove average, fair complexion, dark hair, dark eyes, very often\\na hooked nose and a rather wide mouth. \\n\\nInvestigations carried out by N.

Checking my memory map thanks to Now Menus,\\nI see that HP Backgrounder has not loaded. Restarting fixes this.

I have experienced\\nproblems in putting my computer to sleep. Choosing \"sleep\" from the\\nFinder menu sometimes does nothing. Today on a whim I checked the memory\\nmap, and I discovered that HP backgrounder was not loaded. Restarted\\nreloaded HP backgrounder, and I was able to put my machine to sleep as\\nusual.

In addition to the\\nchange in title, the revised ETR BOM has been shortened by several pages\\n(eliminating many extraneous \"that\\'s\" and \"of\\'s\"), and many (minor) errors\\nhave been corrected. This release includes a simplified Joseph Smith Story,\\ntestimonies of the three and eight witnesses, and a \"Words-to-Know\"\\nglossary.\\n\\nAs with the previous announcement, readers are reminded that this is a\\nnot-for-profit endeavor. This is a copyrighted work, but people are welcome\\nto make *verbatim* copies for personal use. People can recuperate the\\nactual costs of printing (paper, copy center charges), but may not charge\\nanything for their time in making copies, or in any way realize a profit\\nfrom the use of this book. See the permissions notice in the book itself\\nfor the precise terms.\\n\\nNegotiations are currently underway with a Mormon publisher vis-a-vis the\\nprinting and distribution of bound books. (Sorry, I\\'m out of the wire-bound\\n\"first editions.\") I will make another announcement about the availability\\nof printed copies once everything has been worked out.\\n\\nFTP information: connect via anonymous ftp to carnot.itc.cmu.edu, then \"cd\\npub\" (you won\\'t see anything at all until you do).\\n\\n\"The Easy-to-Read Book of Mormon\" is currently available in postscript and\\nRTF (rich text format). (ASCII, LaTeX, and other versions can be made\\navailable; contact dba@andrew.cmu.edu for details.) You should be able to\\nprint the postscript file on any postscript printer (such as an Apple\\nLaserwriter); let dba know if you have any difficulties. (The postscript in\\nthe last release had problems on some printers; this time it should work\\nbetter.) RTF is a standard document interchange format that can be read in\\nby a number of word processors, including Microsoft Word for both the\\nMacintosh and Windows. If you don\\'t have a postscript printer, you may be\\nable to use the RTF file to print out a copy of the book.\\n\\n-r--r--r--  1 dba                   1984742 Apr 27 13:12 etrbom.ps\\n-r--r--r--  1 dba                   1209071 Apr 27 13:13 etrbom.rtf\\n\\nFor more information about how this project came about, please refer to my\\narticle in the current issue of _Sunstone_, entitled \"Delighting in\\nPlainness: Issues Surrounding a Simple Modern English Book of Mormon.\"\\n\\nSend all inquiries and comments to:\\n\\n    Lynn Matthews Anderson\\n    5806 Hampton Street\\n    Pittsburgh, PA 15206\\n\\n    dba+lynn@cs.cmu.edu\\n\\n' => comp.windows.x \n",

In the \\nsecond half of 1943 infantry battalions 814, 815 and 816 were created.\\nThese battalions together with other indigenous Caucasian units were\\nattached to the infantry division 162. Also attached to ID 162 were\\nthe field battalions II/9, I/125 and I/198 which were formed between\\nMay 1942 and May 1943. Altogether twelve Armenian battalions served the\\nNazi army, if battalion II/73, which was not employed at any time, is to be\\nincluded.[1] Most battalions were commanded by Nazi Armenian officers.\\nArmenians wore German uniforms with an armband in the Dashnag colours \\nred-blue-orange and the inscription \\'Armenien.\\'\\n\\n[1] Joachim Hoffmann, \\'Dies Ostlegionen 1941-1943, Turkotataren, \\n    Kaukasier und Wolgafinned im deutschen Heer,\\' (Verlag Rombach\\n    Freiburg 1976), p. 172.\\n\\nWhile having collaborated with the Nazis against Stalin during the\\nSecond World War, Nazi Armenians changed their policy after Hitler\\'s\\ndefeat. They now backed Stalin\\'s claims on Eastern Turkish provinces,\\nhoping that these would be annexed to Soviet Armenia and their Muslim \\npopulation would be exterminated. Stalin played on Armenian national\\nsentiments to enlist the support of Armenians in the USSR and America\\nfor his imperial ambitions.[1] Stalin\\'s ultimatum to the Turkish\\ngovernment led Truman to formulate his famous Doctrine.\\n\\n[1] Walter Kolarz, \\'Religion in the Soviet Union,\\' (London, Macmillan &\\n    Co Ltd; New York, St Martin\\'s Press 1961), pp. 160-164.\\n\\nSerdar Argic\\n\\n                           \\'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \\n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \\n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.\\'\\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\\n                           \\'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \\n                            a single Turkish soul.\\' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)\\n\\n' => talk.politics.mideast \n",

I was also\\nshocked when I first realized that you have to offset lines from fills by\\nabout 16 bits (assuming 24 bit z buffer).  This seems huge, but is only\\n1/256 of the dynamic range.  In those terms it doesn\\'t seem so bad.  What\\nis happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear, due\\nmainly to roundoff, I believe.  So the polygon is not planar in z, but is\\nmore like a Ruffles potato chip.  Ditto with lines.  When you start/end at\\ndifferent x/y values, the \"ridges\" are out of phase, resulting in the\\nstitch effect.  You have the same problem if you try to draw 1 polygon\\nright on top of another, but with different vertices.  You will likely see\\na smeared effect where they overlap.\\n  Example:\\n  Try Polygon 1: (100,100,100) (100,200,100) (200,200,100) (200,100,100)\\n      Polygon 2: (125,125,100) (125,175,100) (175,175,100) (175,125,100)\\n\\nYour implementation is correct.  In fact, we do a similar trick when\\nrendering primitives that have lines and polygons - such as NURBS surfaces\\nwith isoparametric lines.  Without the trick, the lines appear stitched, as\\nyou say.  When the application draws lines/polygons independently, the\\nsystem does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting, so the\\napplication must do it.  This is what you have discovered and are doing.\\nBravo!\\n\\n(Note to IBM\\'ers:  The information given here has been previously disclosed\\nthrough proper channels so I\\'m not giving away any new unpublished info.)\\n\\n-- \\n  Mark Einkauf     [ einkauf@austin.ibm.com ]\\n  IBM - Advanced Workstations and Systems - Graphics Systems\\n  Austin TX\\n * Views and opinions expressed herein are not necessarily those of IBM Corp. *\\n' => alt.atheism \n",

The question, really, has to do with the\\nstatus of the Greek Septuagint versus Hebrew scripture.  And the issue\\npredates the Reformation by quite a bit -- Jerome was negative about the\\n\"deuteroncanonicals\" and in fact, even though he transalted them, he put\\nthem after the Hebrew canon (reordered from the Greek ordering to the\\nHebrew one.)  His translations of them were quick-and-dirty, also (he\\nreports having done one of them in one day, and another overnight, just\\ndictating his translation to an amanuensis.\\n\\nThat is to say, it is the Vulgate, and all of its massive importance in\\nWestern Christianity, along with the veneration of Jerome, which took the\\nfirst steps in \"reducing\" these books from the status they had (and have)\\namong the Greeks.\\n\\nFurthermore, it is inaccurate to say that the Reformers \"threw out\" these\\nbooks.  Basically, they just placed them in a secondary status (as Jerome\\nhad already done), but with the additional warning that doctrine should\\nnot be based on citations from these ALONE.\\n\\nI think that the emphasis on the Hebrew originals is sound, though it\\nseems somewhat arbitrary to disallow on the face of it a translation as\\npart of a collection whose principles of selection (in Hebrew or Greek)\\nare confused or unknown and likely fraught with accident.  It also seems\\nto play into a tendentious notion of the original languages being somehow\\n\"more inspired\" -- as if magical, and conveying a message untranslatable\\n-- than a translation, as if we could not hear God\\'s word to the Jews in\\nGreek (or German, or English, ...).  This tendency seems to have got a\\nbig boost in _sola scriptura_ Protestantism, even to the point of current\\n\"inerrancy\" bizarreness, despite the more basic, underlying tendency of\\nthe Reformers to see that the texts SHOULD and COULD be translated.  If\\nwe can profit from an English rendering of Hebrew and Greek, there is\\nsurely little reason to keep Sirach, at least, out of our Bibles (and of\\ncourse, Anglicans don\\'t do so :-)).  For texts originally in Greek, it\\nwould seem more to be anti-Greek prejudice (notably, by the time the\\nHebrew canon is fully attested, including anti-Christian prejudice which\\nled to the Jewish abandonment of the Septuagint) which is operative.\\n\\nBTW: readers may enjoy some lectures of Bruce Metzger on the issues of\\ntranslation of the Bible (including some of what I said about Jerome,\\nabove) in the current numbers of the journal _Bibliotheca Sacra_; two\\nof four have been published so far.\\n-- \\nMichael L.

The following are quotes of his speech: \\n\\n``Kuwait itself was an entity identified as Kuwait even before \\nIraq was identified as Iraq in the Ottoman Empire. Kuwait was in \\nexistence since 1752. We continued to be in existence until the \\nconflict between the Ottoman Empire and the British and others in the \\narea. Thereafter, we signed with the British in 1899 a protective \\nagreement whereby the British guaranteed the sovereignty and security \\nof Kuwait.\\'\\' \\n\\n``In 1913, the British and the Ottoman signed an agreement defining \\nwithout any doubt the borders of Kuwait as they stand today. Such an \\nagreement was reconfirmed in 1932 between the Kuwaiti government \\nand the Iraqi government at that time. That is when Iraq became a state, \\nafter Kuwait itself.\\'\\' \\n\\n``In 1961, when we declared our independence Iraq seized the \\nopportunity to claim Kuwait as part of Iraq. There were threats. The \\nBritish came in, and Arab forces came in to guarantee the sovereignty \\nand territorial integrity of Kuwait. In 1963, Kuwait and Iraq again \\nsigned border agreement, thereby defining our territory and Iraq\\'s \\nrecognition to the sovereignty and territory of Kuwait.\\'\\' \\n\\n---Compiled by Firyal Alshalalbi \\n\\n\\nOrigins of Kuwait \\n\\nThe establishment of Kuwait is attributed to Barrak b. Ghurair of the \\nBani Khalid who used Kuwait as a summer residence. The beginning of \\nKuwait goes back to the late 17th century and some historians go \\nfurther up to 1611. Kuwait\\'s name is derived from al-Kut which means \\nfortress. Kuwait is also called Qurain, which is the diminutive of qarn, a \\nhorn or hill. Kuwait town flourished and grew since its \\nestablishment. \\n\\nThe \\'Utub, al-Sabah family is a branch of \\'Utub, settled in Kuwait \\nduring the early 18th century. They lived under the protection \\nof Bani Khalid until 1752. After that, they became independent and \\nSabah Bin Jabir was chosen as the first ruler for \\'Utub. \\n\\nCarsten Niebuhr (1733-1815) a Dutch explorer was among the first who \\nwrote about the Arabia. He was the mathematician in the scientific \\nexpedition sent in 1760 by the King of Denmark to Arabia. He \\ndocumented details of Arab tribes inhabiting both coasts of the Gulf \\nand in the case of Kuwait, he was the first writer to give the two \\nnames by which the town was known, Kuwait and Qurain. Niebuhr\\'s chart \\nof the Persian Gulf was the best one drawn before the end of that \\ncentury, see the map from Abu Hakima, History of Eastern Arabia \\n1750-1800. pub.1965. \\n\\nAl-Sabah (\\'Utub) kept good relations with other powers in the eastern \\nArabia. According to Ahmed Abu Hakima\\'s conclusions in his well \\ndocumented study about the history of eastern Arabia between 1750-1800, \\nthere was no Ottoman rule on the region. ``In the second half of \\nthe 18th century, there was no Ottoman ruler in Eastern Arabia. \\nIn fact, Ottoman rule was not even nominally acknowledged. Their \\nattempts to restore their lost position in al-Hasa through the \\ncampaign of Thuwayni in 1786, and Ali Pasha\\'s expedition against the \\nWahhabis in 1798, were unsuccessful. At Kuwait, the nearest point of \\nthe Utbi domains to the Ottoman Mutasallimiyya of Basra, the Shaikh \\nwas under no form of Ottoman control. The aim of \\'Utbi external policy \\nwas to keep on friendly relations with all the forces working in the \\nGulf.\\'\\' (p. 182-183) Abu Hakima continued in his conclusions that ``Kuwait \\nwas not a dependency of Basra, the Persian occupation of Basra \\n(1775-79) did not affect Kuwait.\\'\\' (p.183) \\n\\nKuwait had its own identity through the Ottoman domination on the Arab \\nworld. This identity was clear to the British and the French who \\ntried to win the support of Kuwait\\'s Sheikh between 1793-95 when the \\nBritish wanted his support in their conflict with the French in the \\nGulf area. \\n\\n--- \\n\\nIndependent Kuwait \\n\\nThis is the first of a series of articles that testify to the \\nindependence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the \\nOttomans. \\n\\nThe following text is related to an expedition carried out by the \\nOttomans in 1871 against the Wahhabis in Eastern Arabia (where the oil fields \\nin Saudi Arabia now). Kuwait and its ruler at that time, Sheikh \\nAbdulla Ibn Sabah Ibn Jabir, allied themselves with the Turks:} \\n\\nAbdullah\\' role in the fighting was not a minor one. He joined the \\nexpedition as a commander of the large Kuwaiti fleet and was the first \\nto use its guns against the besieged town of Al-Qatif. Had it not been \\nfor this bombardment by the Kuwaiti fleet, Al-Qatif obviously would \\nnot have surrendered in a mere three hours. \\n\\nIn relation to this, a question arises as to why the Ottoman warships \\nrefrained from participating in the bombardment. The answer lies in \\nreports relating to the political movements that preceded accounts of \\nthe progress of the expedition. Because the Ottomans were unwilling to \\njeopardize the maritime peace imposed by Britain in the area,  the \\nSultan and the Pasha promised their warships would not be used in the \\nwar against Su\\'ud or any Sheikh in the war zone. Kuwait, which was not \\na party  to the above-mentioned treaty of 1861, was under no such \\nobligation especially since the expedition was not directed against \\nthose who had signed it. \\n\\n\\n[ From the above text, we can see that Kuwait was not part of the \\nOttomans or the British colonies. For more details about the mentioned \\nexpedition, please check out the source of the above text: \\n\\nThe Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, McGill \\nUniversity, Canada ] \\n\\n--- \\n\\nIndependent Kuwait--2 \\n\\nThis is another article of a series of articles that testify to the \\nindependence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the \\nOttomans. \\n\\nThe following text discusses a dispute on an estate called Sufiyya in Zubair, \\nIraq, between the Sheikh of Kuwait and Al-Zuhair tribe in Zubair. \\n\\nIn 1866, trouble developed over the possession by Sheikh Sabah of the \\nestate which was [purchased] by his father, Sheikh Jabir, in 1836. This \\nproperty was sequestered by a Turkish Qa\\'immaqam [representative] on \\nthe basis of a claim by the Al-Zuhair that the vendor had been the \\nowner of a share and not of the n 100e Sufiyya. At the same time, \\nSheikh Sabah was required to expel from other lands owned by him at \\nthe island of Fao some cultivators who had immigrated from Persian \\nterritory. \\n\\nIt should be recalled that  the Turkish officials from the start \\nshowed strong prejudice in favor of the Zuhair claimants. Abdulla Ibn \\nSabah,  the eldest son of the ruler of Kuwait who went to Basra as his \\nfather\\'s agent in the case,  narrowly escaped being thrown  into jail \\nupon his refusal to make a payment amounting to the value of seven \\nyears produce which the Ottoman authorities deemed the plaintiffs were \\nentitled to receive. \\n\\nEventually, the dispute was settled by the Wali [Governor] of Baghdad \\nin favor of the Sheikh of Kuwait. The decision of the Governor of \\nBasra in favor of the Sheikh was apparently made for various reasons. \\nSome writers think that the Governor wanted to win Abdulla over to the \\nTurkish side, and suggest that the Governor, Namiq Pasha, even offered \\nhim the title of Qa\\'immaqam, which he declined. Nevertheless,  the \\nproceedings of the Turks in this case were regarded by the inhabitants \\nof Kuwait as attempts to cause a confrontation with Zubair. It seems \\nthat they had anticipated a conflict and according to reports by the \\nBritish Agent at Basra, the people of Kuwait were prepared to a man to \\nabandon their town rather than submit to Turkish rule. Lorimer suggests \\nthat the final order of Namiq Pasha, upholding the Kuwait Sheikh\\'s \\ntitle to Sufiyya, was perhaps due to a report that Sheikh Sabah, \\n``with the object of attacking Zubair if the decision should go \\nagainst him, had obtained a promise of countenance and armed support \\nfrom the Wahhabi Amir.\\'\\' \\n\\nIn addition to this legal matter with Zubair, Kuwait had had other \\nproblems with Basra whose courts tried to jail Abdulla Ibn Sabah, as \\nexplained above. However, Kuwait\\'s relations with the Ottoman \\nmutasallims of Basra had at times been amicable and in several \\ninstances, those mutasallims even sought refuge at Kuwait when \\npressured by the Pashas of Baghdad who exercised control over them. \\n\\n[ Source: The Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, \\nMcGill University, Canada ] \\n\\n--- \\n\\nIndependent Kuwait--3 \\n\\nThis is another article that testifies to the \\nindependence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the \\nOttomans. \\n\\n\\nWhen Pelly [Colonel Pelly, the British Resident in the Gulf] visited Kuwait \\nfor the first time on March 3, 1863, he was \\nmet at Jahra by Sheikh Mubarak, the second son of the ruler, Sheikh \\nSabah. Just before he reached Kuwait town on March 4, he was met by \\nSheikh Abdulla, the eldest son and heir apparent, who accompanied him \\nto the town gate on their way to ``a very good home,\\'\\' which had been \\nprepared for Pelly and his companions. ``Scarcely had we entered it,\\'\\' \\nsays Pelly, ``when Sheikh Sabah himself came.\\'\\' \\nThis description of Pelly\\'s reception indicates that to a certain \\ndegree it was run according to protocol. \\n\\nThe government system of Kuwait and administration of justice were the \\nsubject of comments made by Pelly. ``The Government is patriarchal,\\'\\' \\nsays Pelly, ``the Sheikh managing the political, and the Cazee [Qadi] \\nthe judicial departments. The Sheikh himself would submit to the \\nCazee\\'s decision.\\'\\' Punishment was rarely inflicted. ``Indeed, there \\nseems little government interference anywhere, and little need of an \\narmy.\\'\\' Pelly in admiration of how the Sheikh ran the affairs of the \\ncountry, retold the following remark which the Sheikh had made to him: \\n\\nWhen my father was nearly 120 years old, he called me and said, ``I \\nshall soon die. I have made no fortune, and can leave you no money, \\nbut I have made many and true friends, grapple them. While other \\nstates around the Gulf have fallen off from injustice or \\nill-government, mine has gone on [flourishing]. Hold to my policy, and \\nthough you are surrounded by  desert, and pressed by a once hostile \\nand still wandering set of tribes, you will prosper.\\'\\' \\n\\n[ Source: The Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, \\nMcGill University, Canada ] \\n\\n--- \\n\\nIndependent Kuwait--4 \\n\\nThis is another article that testifies to the \\nindependence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the \\nOttomans. \\n\\n\\nThe British had always regarded Sheikh Jabir as a ``good friend,\\'\\' but \\nin October 1839, an event took place at Kuwait which could have \\nweakened those good relations. On October 30, Lieutenant Edmunds, the \\nAssistant Resident at Abu Shahr [in Iran], arrived in Kuwait on  a \\nspecial mission from the Resident, Captain Hennell. His mission was to \\nfind out if Kuwait was willing to welcome the establishment of a \\nBritish line of post across the desert from Kuwait to the \\nMediterranean. The British war vessel fired the usual salute in honor \\nof the Sheikh after it had anchored in the waters of Kuwait Bay. The \\nsalute was not acknowledged and Edmunds waited in the vessel for three \\ndays before he was able to communicate with the Sheikh. \\n\\nAfter Edmunds\\' return to Abu Shahr, both he and Captain Hennell \\nexplained this unusual behavior of the Sheikh, to have been due not \\nto ill-will, but principally to a desire to mislead the Egyptian agent \\nat Kuwait as to the nature of his relations with the British. \\nTherefore, they considered that Jabir\\'s conduct did not indicate any \\nchange in his friendly policies towards the British. \\n\\nIf the British tolerated the attitude of Jabir towards Edmunds, so \\nalso did the Egyptians. Earlier in the same year, some of the most \\nwanted men in the Wahhabi camp, such as \\'Umar Ibn \\'Ufaisan, the \\nWahhabi general  in Al-Hasa, and Wahhabi tribes like Al-Duwaish, \\nsought refuge in Kuwait. \\n\\nProtection of refugees seeking political \\nasylum in his country was a policy that had been adopted earlier by \\nSheikh Abdulla Ibn Sabah. This can, therefore, be looked upon as an \\nindication of self-confidence; an outcome of Kuwait\\'s independence \\nfrom foreign powers. It corroborates the fact that Kuwait, if \\nnecessary, was prepared to defend itself against more powerful \\nneighbors. \\n\\nThis defense depended not only on the walls of the city, but also on \\nbedouin tribes in its neighborhood and a merchant fleet equipped with \\nthe necessary guns comparable to other Arab fleets of the time. \\n\\nAs to Kuwait\\'s position between 1815 and 1839, one can safely state \\nthat it managed to maintain a neutral policy with regard to the \\nstruggling Wahhabis and Egyptians. Relations with the British  and \\neven with the Pasha of Baghdad continued on good terms. \\n\\n[ Source: The Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, \\nMcGill University, Canada ] \\n\\n--- \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  They were trying to recover land they believed \\n  was theirs, much like the Argentines in the Faulklands.

Since Christians citing the Bible in such a context\\nshould be presumed to have at least READ the story, it amounts to slander\\n-- a charge that homosexuality == rape -- to use that against us.\\n\\n>\"... Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolators, nor adulterers, \\n>nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, \\n>nor revilers, nor swindlers, shall inherit the kingdom  of God.  And such were \\n>some of you...\"  I Cor. 6:9-11.\\n\\nThe moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of _porneia_\\nin this.  I think we can all agree (with Paul) that there are SOME kinds of\\nactivity that could be named by \"fornication\" or \"theft\" or \"coveting\" or\\n\"reviling\" or \"drunkenness\" which would well deserve condemnation.  We may\\nor may not agree to the bounds of those categories, however; and the very\\nfact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at\\nall \"clear\" but that Paul -- an excellent rhetorician -- had no interest\\nin MAKING them clear, leaving matters rather to our Spirit-led decisions,\\nwith all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that has dominated\\nChristian discussion of ALL these areas.\\n\\nHomosexual behavior is no different.  I (and the other gay Christians I\\nknow) are adamant in condemning rape -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and\\nchild molestation -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and even the possibly\\n\"harmless\" but obsessive kinds of sex -- heterosexual or homosexual --\\nthat would stand condemned by Paul in the very continuation of the chapter\\nyou cite [may I mildly suggest that what *Paul* does in his letter that\\nyou want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning?]\\n\\n\\t\"\\'I am free to do anything,\\' you say.  Yes, but not everything\\n\\tis for my good.  No doubt I am free to do anything, but I for one\\n\\twill not let anything make free with me.\"  [1 Cor. 6:12]\\n\\nWhich is a restatement that we must have no other \"god\" before God.  A\\ncommandment neither I nor any other gay Christian wishes to break.  Some\\npeople are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior.\\nIt is just as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so it\\'s a secondary\\nargument from the \\'phobic contingent) to equate homosexuality with such\\nbehavior as to equate it with the rape of God\\'s messengers.\\n\\nI won\\'t deal with the exegesis of Leviticus, except very tangentially.\\nFundamentally, you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your\\nassumption that you know what _porneia_ means.  There are plenty of\\nlaws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus, most of\\nwhich Christians ignore completely.  They never even BOTHER to examine\\nthem.  They just *assume* that they know which ones are \"moral\" and\\nwhich ones are \"ritual.\"  Well, I have news for you.  Any anthropology\\ncourse should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categories\\nin an awful lot of societies (we have them too, but buried pretty deep).\\nAnd I cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of Leviticus\\nfrom the \"ritual law\" which NO Christian I know feels applies to us.\\n\\nI\\'m dead serious here.  When people start going on (as they do in this\\nmatter) about how \"repulsive\" and \"unnatural\" our acts are -- and what\\ndo they know about it, huh? -- it is a solid clue to the same sort of\\narbitrary cultural inculcations as the American prejudice against eating\\ninsects.  On what basis, other than assuming your conclusion, can you\\nsay that the law against male-male intercourse in Leviticus is NOT a part\\nof the ritual law?\\n\\nFor those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can\\nbe \"law\" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about)\\nit is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to\\ndetermine why you \"pick\" one and ignore another.  I frankly think the\\nwhole effort misguided.  Reread Paul: \"No doubt I am free to do anything.\"\\nBut Christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this,\\nthe Great Commandment of love for God and neighbor.  If you cannot go\\nthrough Leviticus and decide each \"command\" there on that basis, then\\nyour own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy.  In this\\ncontext, it is remarkably offensive to say:\\n\\n>I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the\\n>verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse.\\n\\nWell, la-ti-da.  So what?  This is almost as slimey an argument as the\\none that homosexuality == rape.  I know of no one who argues seriously\\n(though one can always find jokers) in \"defense\" of bestiality.  It is\\nabsolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians *do*\\nraise (which concern sexual activity within committed, consensual human\\nadult realtionships), so that your bringing it up is no more relevant\\nthan the laws of kashrut.  If you cannot address the actual issues, you\\nare being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the\\nworld.  If *you* want to address bestiality, that is YOUR business, not\\nmine.  And attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in\\nour culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing\\nus as human beings.  You want to dismiss us, and use the sleaziest means\\nyou can think of to do so.\\n\\nJesus and Paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length,\\nthe central linch-pin of Christian moral thought: we are required to\\nlove one another, and ALL else depends on that.  Gay and lesbian Christ-\\nians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we get\\nin return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues.\\n\\nChristians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here and in every\\ncorner of USENET and the world, and ALL they ever do is spout these same\\nold verses (which they obviously have never thought about, maybe never\\neven read), in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with\\nthe vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can\\nmanage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great\\nemotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even\\ntaking the trouble to find out what it is.\\n\\nSuch behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ.\\nWHY, for God\\'s precious sake, do you people quote irrelevant verses to\\ncondemn people you don\\'t know and won\\'t even take the trouble to LISTEN\\nto BEFORE you start your condemnations?  Is that loving your neighbor?\\nGod forbid!  Is THAT how you obey the repeated commands to NOT judge or\\ncondemn others?  Christ and Paul spend ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more time in\\ninsisting on this than the half-dozen obscure words in Paul that you are\\nSO bloody ready to take as license to do what God tells you NOT to do.\\n\\nWhy, for God\\'s sake?\\n\\n\\t\"For God did not send the Son into the world\\n\\tto condemn the world,\\n\\tbut that the world might be saved through him.\\n\\tWhoever believes in him is not condemned,\\n\\tbut whoever does not believe has already been condemned\\n\\tfor refusing to believe in the name of God\\'s only Son.\\n\\tNow the judgment is this:\\n\\tthe light has come into the world,\\n\\tbut men have preferred darkness to light\\n\\tbecause their deeds were evil.\\n\\tFor everyone who practices wickedness\\n\\thates the light,\\n\\tand does not come near the light\\n\\tfor fear his deeds will be exposed.\\n\\tBut he who acts in truth\\n\\tcomes into the light,\\n\\tso that it may be sh0own\\n\\tthat his deeds are done in God.\"\\tJohn 3:17-21\\n\\nFor long ages, we (many of us) have been confused by evil counsel from\\nevil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and\\nrejected.

Also,  library research\\nseems to show that Benadryl is the antihistamine with the strongest\\nsedative effect of what is availible OTC.  So I might also buy a generic\\nform of that and try that;  the PDR seems to suggest that 50 mg is a good\\ndosage level to try.\\n\\n\\tFor other medical information,  I have allergies but rarely have\\nan allergic reaction living in New Mexico.  I also have chronically dry\\neyes,  which get horrible if I try to use most underarm deoderants.  I did\\nguess that my problem might be caused by hypoglycemia,  so I made some\\nchanges in my diet consistent with that,  and it didn't help,  so I\\nwent back to a normal diet (Pretty diverse,  also taking vitamin supplements)\\n\\n\\tAnyway,  I am looking for advice for the use of\\nantihistamines as sleep aids,  and if there are any dangers of such use\\n(Seems safe to me since they are used chronically for allergies by\\nmillions).  I don't want to try BZs,  because BZ addiction seems to be\\na serious threat,  and from what I hear,  BZ sleep quality is not good,\\nwhereas antihistamine sleep quality seems to be better for me.  I have\\ntried some dietary tryptophan loading stuff,  and that also seems to\\nlower sleep quality,  I seem to wake up around 4:00 or so and be in some\\nkind of mental haze until 7:00 or 8:00.  Also,  I would be interested in\\nany other advice for helping my problem.  (Although I've already tried\\nmany of the non-pharmacological solutions)\\n\" => talk.politics.misc \n",

Indications were that the spacecraft had entered a\\nFault Protection mode sometime between that time and receipt of normal\\ntelemetry at the end of the previous station pass (DSS-15 - Goldstone 34\\nmeter antenna) at approximately 8:00 PM the evening before.  Entry into\\nContingency Mode was verified when signal was reacquired and telemetry\\nindicated that the spacecraft was sun coning.  After subsystem engineers\\nreported all systems performing nominally, fault protection telemetry modes\\nwere reconfigured and memory readouts of command system Audit Queue and\\nAACS (Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem) Starex performed.  These\\nreadouts verified that Contingency Mode entry occurred shortly after 1:30 AM\\nyesterday, 4/29/93.  Preliminary indications are that a Sun Ephemeris Check\\nfailure triggered fault protection.  However, the Flight Team will be\\ndetermining the precise cause over the next few days.\\n\\nAs of last evening, the spacecraft had been commanded back to Inertial\\nReference and was stable in that mode.  The Flight Team is planning to\\ncommand the spacecraft back to Array Normal Spin state today.\\n\\nMagnetometer Calibration activities had completed prior to Contingency\\nMode entry.  MAG Calibration data has been recorded on Digital Tape\\nRecorders 2 and 3.  Playback of DTRs 2 and 3, scheduled to be completed\\nyesterday, was postponed when Contingency Mode entry halted Flight\\nSequence C9 execution.  The Flight Team is developing a strategy to restart\\nC9 to complete data playback.  Present planning is to perform playbacks\\nbetween  as soon as Wednesday, or as late as Friday of next week (5/5-\\n5/7), dependent on Contingency Mode recovery activity.  DTR playback will\\nbe performed via the High Gain Antenna at 42,667 bits per second.  Upon\\nverification of successful DTR playbacks, downlink will be maintained at\\nthe 4K S & E rate.\\n     ___    _____     ___\\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\\\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\\n    | | | |  __ \\\\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand\\n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and\\n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.\\n\\n' => sci.space \n",

Basically, the U.S. Government has gotten into the role of\\nsupporting research which private industry finds too expensive or too\\nlong-term.  \\n\\n(Historically, this role for the U.S. Gov\\'t was forced upon it because\\nof socialism in other countries.

I believe that market forces should\\ndrive technology, and the world would be a better place for it.  But\\nthe whole world would have to implement this concept simultaneously, or\\nsome countries would have subsidized R&D, while others would not.  So\\nthe U.S. must subsidize because everybody else does.  (This sounds a\\nlot like the farm subsidies arguments behind our GATT negotiations,\\ndoesn\\'t it?)\\n\\nBut this role of Government subsidies is antithetical to\\ncost-effectiveness.  The general idea is to spend money on new\\ntechnology, and thereby maintain and promote our technological culture,\\ndespite the forces in the business world (like the dreaded quarterly\\nearnings report) which erode the ability of U.S. industry to invest in\\nnew technology.

Cd for cars is\\nusually calculated based on the frontal area of the car.  So a large car\\nwith a good Cd could get the same drag force as a smaller car with a\\npoorer Cd. \\n\\nTo calculate drag use this formula:\\n\\nD = 1/2 * rho * v^2 * Cd * S\\n\\nWhere D is the drag force (lbs), rho is the local air density (slugs/ft^3),\\nV is the velocity (ft/s), and S is the frontal area (ft^2).  Note that the\\npieces called 1/2 * rho * v^2 are sometimes called qbar or dynamic pressure\\n(a fancy aero term for air pressure or force). \\n\\nNote that power is:\\n\\nP = F * v\\n\\nWhere P is power (lbf-ft/s), F is the force, drag in this case (lbf) and v\\nis velocity (ft/s). \\n\\nNote that if you put the whole equation into one (by substituting D for\\nforce) you get a velocity _cubed_ term.

Let\\'s consider some \"personal interpretations\"\\nand see how much trust we should put in \"Orthodox Mormonism\", which\\ncould never be confused with Orthodox Christianity.\\n\\n        In one of his attacks on Christians, the Mormon Apostle Bruce R.\\nMcConkie said they \"thrash around in...darkness in trying to identify\\nElohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the promised\\nMessiah.\" He also said Christians are wrong to believe \"that Jehovah is\\nthe Supreme Deity [God the Father],\" and that Christ \"came into\\nmortality\" as His \"Only Begotten\" Son. McConkie then stated what Mormons\\nbelieve today to be the truth about the matter. He said that \"Elohim is\\nthe Father\" and \"Jehovah is the Son.\"\\n\\n  \"Being thus aware of how far astray the religious intellectualists\\n  have gone in defining their three-in-one God, it comes as no surprise\\n  to learn that they thrash around in the same darkness in trying to\\n  identify Elohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the\\n  promised Messiah. Some sectarians even believe that Jehovah is the\\n  Supreme Deity whose Son came into mortality as the Only Begotten. As\\n  with their concept that God is a Spirit, this misinformation about the\\n  Gods of Heaven is untrue. The fact is, and it too is attested by Holy\\n  Writ, that Elohim is the Father, and that Jehovah is the Son who was\\n  born into mortality as the Lord Jesus Christ, the promised Messiah.\\n  (Promised Messiah, p. 100)\\n\\n        Notice that McConkie said the Christians are as wrong about\\ntheir \"three-in-one God\" and their belief that \"God is a Spirit\" as they\\nare in their understanding of who \"Elohim\" and \"Jehovah\" are. Before\\nexamining McConkie\\'s attack and its validity, we shall read a few more\\nstatements by McConkie and other Mormon sources concerning the words\\n\"Elohim\" and \"Jehovah.\" McConkie stated:\\n\\n  \"...the chief designation of Christ that has been preserved for us in\\n  the Old Testament, as that ancient work is now published, is the\\n  exalted name-title Jehovah. (Promised Messiah, p. 367)\\n\\n  \"_Elohim_, plural word though it is, is also used as the exalted\\n  name-title of God the Eternal Father, a usage that connotes his\\n  supremacy and omnipotence, he being God above all Gods. (Mormon\\n  Doctrine, p. 224)\\n\\n        Agreeing with McConkie on the question of who \"Elohim\" and\\n\"Jehovah\" are, the Apostle James E. Talmage stated:\\n\\n  \"_Elohim_, as understood and used in the restored Church of Jesus\\n  Christ, is the name-title of God the Eternal Father, whose firstborn\\n  Son in the spirit is _Jehovah_ -- the Only Begotten in the flesh,\\n  Jesus Christ. (Jesus the Christ, p. 38)\\n\\n        \"A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and the Twelve\"\\napostles of the Mormon Church states that \"God the Eternal Father...[is]\\ndesignate[d] by the exalted name-title \\'Elohim\\'...\" (Articles of Faith,\\np. 466) \"...Christ in His preexistent, antemortal, or unembodied\\nstate...was known as Jehovah...\" (Articles of Faith, p. 471)\\n\\n        Today Mormon leaders teach that \"Elohim\" in the OT refers to God\\nthe Father and \"Jehovah\" refers to Christ. McConkie attacked Christians\\nfor saying \"Jehovah\" can refer to the Father. He stressed that these two\\n\"name-titles\" should not be changed around so that Christ is called\\n\"Elohim\" and the Father is called \"Jehovah.\" \"...the Father...is Elohim,\\nnot Jehovah.... Jehovah is Christ, and Christ is Jehovah; they are one\\nand the same person.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 111)\\n\\n        In the OT of the KJV of the Bible, the Hebrew word \"Elohim\" is\\nused to refer to the true God, false gods and goddesses, and the judges\\nof Israel. When referring to the true God, \"Elohim\" is translated with a\\ncapital \"G.\" When referring to false gods and goddesses and the judges\\nof Israel, it is translated with a small \"g.\" It is translated four\\ntimes as \"judges\" (Exod. 21:6; 22:8-9), once as \"judge\" (1 Sam. 2:25),\\ntwice as \"mighty\" (Gen. 23:6; Exod. 9:28), once as \"angels\" (Ps. 8:5),\\nonce as \"godly\" (Mal. 2:15), once as \"great\" (Gen. 30:8), and once as\\n\"very great.\" (1 Sam. 14:15)\\n\\n        The word \"Jehovah\" is the traditional pronunciation of the\\ntetragrammation YHWH or YHVH with the vowel points taken from the word\\n\"Adonai.\"  Many people believe the true pronunciation of the\\ntetragrammation was Yahweh or Yahveh. However, since \"Jehovah\" rather\\nthan Yahweh is the word used by Mormonism, this section will also use\\n\"Jehovah\" instead of Yahweh to examine the validity of the claims of\\nMormon leaders regarding that name. \"Jehovah,\" unlike \"Elohim,\" is never\\nused of false gods. It is the personal name of the triune God of the\\nBible. In the KJV, \"Jehovah\" is rendered primarily \"LORD,\" sometimes\\n\"GOD,\" and rarely \"Lord.\"\\n\\n        Now that we understand something about the words \"Elohim\" and\\n\"Jehovah\" and their use by Mormon leaders, we shall consider the Apostle\\nMcConkie\\'s attack on Christians for believing the Father is \"Jehovah.\"\\nIn trying to prove that \"Jehovah\" refers exclusively to Christ, McConkie\\ncited several verses from the Bible. Some of these verses and McConkie\\'s\\ninterpretation of them will be examined to see whether he was right.\\nRemember, McConkie said the Father is not \"Jehovah;\" He is only\\n\"Elohim.\" The first example we shall consider involves McConkie\\'s\\ninterpretation of Ps. 110:1. Of this verse he stated:\\n\\n  \"Of whom spake David when his tongue was touched by the Holy Spirit\\n  and he testified, \"The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right\\n  hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?\" (Ps. 110:1.) Two\\n  Lords are here involved: one is speaking to the other; one is greater\\n  than the other; one is making provision for the triumph and glory of\\n  the other. Who are they and what message is contained in this\\n  Messianic prophecy?\\n  \"What think ye of Christ?\" our Lord asked certain of his detractors\\n  toward the end of his mortal ministry. \"Whose son is he?\" Is Christ\\n  the Son of God or of someone else? Is he to be born of a divine Parent\\n  or will he be as other men -- a mortal son of a mortal father? That he\\n  was to be a descendant of David was a matter of great pride to all the\\n  Jews. And so they answered, \"The Son of David.\"\\n  David\\'s son? Truly he was. But he was more, much more. And so our\\n  Lord, with irrefutable logic and to their complete discomfiture,\\n  asked, \"How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying, The Lord\\n  said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine\\n  enemies thy footstool? If David then call him Lord, how is he his\\n  son?\" That is, if he is only the Son of David, how is it that the\\n  great King, acting under inspiration, calls him Lord and worships him\\n  as such? And we might add: _Who is the other Lord, the one who spake\\n  unto David\\'s Lord?_ Can there be any question as to how Jesus is\\n  interpreting the words of the Psalm? He is saying that it means: \\'_The\\n  Father said unto the Son, Elohim said unto Jehovah_, sit thou on my\\n  right hand, until after your mortal ministry; then I will raise you up\\n  to eternal glory and exaltation with me, where you will continue to\\n  sit on my right hand forever.\\' (Promised Messiah, pp. 101-102)\\n  (emphasis added)\\n\\n        Agreeing with the above statement by McConkie, the following\\nremark in the Mormon pamphlet _What the Mormons Think of Christ, p. 6\\nreads: \"The Lord [Elohim, the Father] said unto my Lord [Jehovah, the\\nSon]...\" (brackets in original)\\n\\n        McConkie clearly stated that it is \"Elohim\" the Father who is\\nspeaking to \"Jehovah\" the Son in this Psalm. However, when one looks at\\nthe Hebrew word translated \"LORD,\" it becomes apparent that either the\\nfirst \"LORD\" is not the Father or else the Father is \"Jehovah.\" Either\\nway McConkie is wrong. The Psalm reads:\\n\\n  \"The LORD [Jehovah] said unto my Lord [Adon], Sit thou at my right\\n  hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. (Ps. 110:1)\\n\\n        The first \"LORD\" in this verse is \"Jehovah\" who Mormonism says\\nis Christ, not the Father. The second \"Lord\" is the Hebrew word \"Adon\"\\n(singular for \"Adonai,\" meaning master or lord). If the first \"LORD\" is\\nthe Father and the second \"Lord\" is the Son, then the Father is\\n\"Jehovah\" and the Son is \"Adon.\" However, if the Father is not \"Jehovah\"\\nas McConkie claimed, then the first \"LORD\" is \"Jehovah\" the Son, but\\nwho, then, is \"Adon?\" Obviously the Father is \"Jehovah\" in this Psalm,\\nand His Son is \"Adon.\"\\n\\n        Another example involves Isa. 42:6 about which McConkie stated\\nthe following:\\n\\n  \"I the Lord have called thee in righteousness,\" _Isaiah quoted the\\n  Father as saying of Christ_, \"and will hold thine hand, and will keep\\n  thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the\\n  Gentiles.\" (Isa. 42:6.) (Promised Messiah, p. 81) (emphasis added)\\n\\n        McConkie said the Father was speaking of Christ in this passage\\nwhich reads:\\n\\n  \"I the LORD [Jehovah] have called thee in righteousness, and will hold\\n  thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the\\n  people, for a light of the Gentiles. (Isa. 42:6)\\n\\n        According to McConkie, \"I the LORD\" refers to the Father, and\\n\"thine\" and \"thee\" refer to Christ. However, the \"LORD\" who is speaking\\nis \"Jehovah\" which means either McConkie was wrong about who is speaking\\nor else the Father is \"Jehovah.\"\\n\\n        Another example involves Ps. 22:7-8. Of these verses McConkie\\nstated:\\n\\n  \"The same Psalm says: \"All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they\\n  shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, He trusted on the Lord\\n  that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in\\n  him.\" (Ps. 22:7-8.) _The fulfillment, as Jesus hung on the cross_, is\\n  found in these words: \"The chief priests mocking him, with the scribes\\n  and elders, said, He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be\\n  the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will\\n  believe him. He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will\\n  have him: for he said, I am the Son of God. The thieves also, which\\n  were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.\" (Matt.\\n  27:41-44.) (Promised Messiah, pp. 530-531) (emphasis added)\\n\\n        Ps. 22:7-8 reads as follows:\\n\\n  \"All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they\\n  shake the head, saying, He trusted on the LORD [Jehovah] that he would\\n  deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.\\n\\n        McConkie said these verses had their fulfillment \"as Jesus hung\\non the cross.\" That means the person who was scorned in these verses was\\nChrist. Who, then, was the \"LORD\" in whom he trusted? It was \"Jehovah\"\\nthe Father.\\n\\n        Another example involves Ps. 31:13 and Ps. 41:9. Regarding them,\\nMcConkie stated the following:\\n\\n  \"With reference to the conniving and conspiring plots incident to our\\n  Lord\\'s arrest and judicial trials the prophecy was: \"They took counsel\\n  together against me, they devised to take away my life.\" (Ps. 31:13.)\\n  As to the role of Judas in those conspiracies, the Psalmist says:\\n  \"Mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my\\n  bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.\" (Ps. 41:9.) (Promised\\n  Messiah, p. 532)\\n\\n        Apostle McConkie said these Psalms refer to Christ\\'s \"arrest and\\njudicial trials.\" We shall first consider Ps. 31 and then Ps. 41. While\\nMcConkie only quoted verse 13 of Ps. 31, verse 14 will also be included\\nto give a complete understanding of the matter.\\n\\n  \"For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while\\n  they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my\\n  life. But I trusted in thee, O LORD [Jehovah]: I said, Thou art my God\\n  [Elohim]. (Ps. 31:13-14)\\n\\n        McConkie said verse 13 referred to Jesus Christ. Verse 14 goes\\non to tell that He (Christ) trusted in the \"LORD\" who is called His\\n\"God\" or \"Elohim.\" Mormonism teaches that the God above Jesus is\\n\"Elohim\" the Father. Verse 14, however, reveals that the \"Elohim\" of the\\nman Jesus is \"Jehovah\" the Father.\\n\\n        In Ps. 41, McConkie only quoted one verse; however, two verses\\nwill be considered in this examination.\\n\\n  \"Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my\\n  bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.\\n  But thou, O LORD [Jehovah], be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that\\n  I may requite them. (Ps. 41:9-10)\\n\\n        McConkie stated above that verse 9 referred to Judas\\' role in\\nChrist\\'s death. Since it was Judas who was the \"familiar friend\" who\\n\"lifted up his heel,\" the pronouns \"mine,\" \"I,\" \"my,\" and \"me\" in verse\\n9 must refer to Christ. Notice that at the beginning of verse 10 there\\nis a change of pronoun to \"thou,\" which refers to the \"LORD\" (Jehovah).\\nThen the pronouns \"me\" and \"I\" which refer to Christ are used again.\\nThat means Christ was speaking to \"Jehovah\" the Father in these verses.\\n\\n        Another example involves McConkie\\'s following remark about Ps.\\n        110:4.\\n\\n  \"One of the great Messianic prophecies, spoken by the mouth of David,\\n  says: \"The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for\\n  ever after the order of Melchizedek.\" (Ps. 110:4.) (Promised Messiah,\\n  p. 450)\\n\\n        McConkie admitted this is a Messianic prophecy involving Christ.\\nThe question is, What in this verse refers to Christ?\\n\\n  \"The LORD [Jehovah] hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest\\n  for ever after the order of Melchizedek. (Ps. 110:4)\\n\\n        Does the \"LORD,\" which is \"Jehovah,\" refer to Christ? If\\nMcConkie is right and Jesus is \"Jehovah,\" but the Father is not, then\\nthe \"LORD\" would have to refer to Christ. But who, then, is the one\\naddressed as the \"priest forever after the order of Melchizedek?\" The\\nBible reveals that the one referred to is Jesus Christ (Heb. 5:8-10;\\n6:20; 7); therefore, the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) in Ps. 110:4 is the Father.\\n\\n        Another example involves Isa. 53:4-12. Of these verses McConkie\\nstated:\\n\\n  \"Of the atoning sacrifice of the future Messiah, Isaiah said...\\n     The _Lord_ has laid on him the iniquities of us all....\\n     It pleased the _Lord_ to bruise him... (Promised Messiah, p. 234)\\n     (emphasis added)\\n\\n        McConkie rightly said these verses refer to \"the atoning\\nsacrifice of the future Messiah.\" However, what he failed to mention is\\nthat they also prove that the Father is \"Jehovah.\" Verse 6 reads: \"All\\nwe like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way;\\nand the LORD [Jehovah] hath laid on him [Christ] the iniquity of us\\nall,\" and verse 10 reads: \"Yet it pleased the LORD [Jehovah] to bruise\\nhim [Christ]...\"\\n\\n        Obviously the \"LORD\" who laid on Christ \"the iniquity of us all\"\\nand who bruised Him is God the Father who is called \"Jehovah\" in these\\nverses.\\n\\n        Remember, McConkie stated that \"some sectarians even believe\\nthat Jehovah is the Supreme Deity,\" and that Christ \"came into\\nmortality\" as His \"Only Begotten\" Son. He called this concept\\n\"misinformation\" that is \"untrue.\" To prove that it is McConkie who is\\nmisinformed and believing untruth, two Scriptural references (2 Sam.\\n7:14; Ps. 2:7) will be examined. McConkie stated the following regarding\\nthese Scriptures:\\n\\n  \"In the midst of a passage that is clearly Messianic, the Lord says of\\n  the Seed of David: \"I will be his father, and he shall be my son.\" (2\\n  Sam. 7:14.) In the second Psalm, the whole of which is also clearly\\n  Messianic, occurs this statement: \"Thou art my Son; this day have I\\n  begotten thee.\" (Ps. 2:7.) Paul quotes both of these statements in\\n  Hebrews 1:5 and says they are prophecies that Christ would come as the\\n  Son of God. (Promised Messiah, p. 143)\\n\\n        McConkie cited Heb. 1:5 to show that 2 Sam. 7:14 and Ps. 2:7\\nrefer to Christ who \"would come as the Son of God.\" Since McConkie first\\nreferenced 2 Sam. 7:14, this examination will, too. However, along with\\nverse 14, verses 11-13 will also be included.\\n\\n  \"And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people\\n  Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the\\n  LORD [Jehovah] telleth thee that he will make thee an house.\\n  And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers,\\n  I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy\\n  bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.\\n  He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of\\n  his kingdom for ever. I will be his father, and he shall be my son. (2\\n  Sam. 7:11-14)\\n\\n        These verses teach that the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) would have a Son,\\nthe Messiah.\\n        In the second example McConkie cited Ps. 2:7. This examination\\nwill include verse 8. Notice that it is the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) who says,\\n\"Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.\"\\n\\n  \"I will declare the decree: the LORD [Jehovah] hath said unto me, Thou\\n  art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.\\n  Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance,\\n  and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.\\n\\n        McConkie said these verses of Scripture are \"clearly Messianic,\"\\nand he acknowledged they teach that \"Christ would come as the Son of\\nGod.\" What he is not willing to acknowledge, however, is that these\\nScriptures also teach that the Father is \"Jehovah\" and that the\\n\"sectarians\" who believe \"Jehovah is the Supreme Deity whose Son\" is\\nJesus Christ, \"the Only Begotten,\" are right in their belief.\\n\\n        Another example involves Mic. 5:4. Of this verse McConkie stated\\nthe following:\\n\\n  \"And so, truly, did our Lord act _during his mortal ministry! Truly,\\n  this is he of whom it is written_: \"He shall stand and feed in the\\n  strength of the Lord, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his\\n  God... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.\" (Mic.\\n  5:4.) (Promised Messiah, p. 182) (emphasis added)\\n\\n        According to McConkie, the pronoun \"He\" at the beginning of Mic.\\n5:4 refers to Christ \"during his mortal ministry.\" Who, then, is the\\n\"LORD his God?\" Mic. 5:4 reads:\\n\\n  \"And he [Christ] shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD\\n  [Jehovah], in the majesty of the name of the LORD [Jehovah] his God\\n  [Elohim]... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.\\n\\n        Obviously the \"LORD\" of Jesus Christ is \"Jehovah\" the Father who\\nis referred to as \"Jehovah his Elohim.\"\\n\\n        Another example involves Ps. 2:2 and Isa. 61:1. Of these verses\\nMcConkie stated the following:\\n\\n  \"A number of Messianic passages speak of \"the Lord, and...his\\n  anointed\" (Ps. 2:2), signifying that the Chosen One was consecrated\\n  and set apart for the ministry and mission that was his. _Jesus\\n  applied these passages to himself_ by quoting Isaiah\\'s prophecy. \"The\\n  Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek\" (Isa.\\n  61:1), and then saying: \"This day is this scripture fulfilled in your\\n  ears\" (Luke 4:21). (Promised Messiah, pp. 182-183) (emphasis added)\\n\\n        The first source McConkie quoted -- Ps. 2:2 -- reads as follows:\\n\\n  \"The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel\\n  together, against the LORD [Jehovah], and against his anointed.\\n\\n        McConkie said the \"anointed\" one was Christ. If that is true,\\nwho was \"Jehovah?\" If \"Jehovah\" is always Christ, who was the \"anointed\"\\none? Obviously \"Jehovah\" is referring to God the Father and the\\n\"anointed\" is indeed referring to Christ. The second source McConkie\\ncited is Isa. 61:1 which states:\\n\\n  \"The Spirit of the Lord [Adonai] GOD [Jehovah] is upon me; because the\\n  LORD [Jehovah] hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek;\\n  he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to\\n  the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;\\n\\n        The one who was anointed to preach, bind up, proclaim, and open\\nwas Jesus Christ. Who, then, was the one who anointed Him? This verse\\nsays the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) did the anointing. Again, we face the same\\nproblem. If \"Jehovah\" does not refer to the Father, but only to Christ,\\nthen Jesus anointed someone, but who? As McConkie pointed out, \"Jesus\\napplied these passages to himself.\" Therefore, the \"Jehovah\" who\\nanointed Christ is God the Father.\\n\\n        Other examples could be cited to show that McConkie and other\\nMormon leaders are wrong when they say God the Father is not \"Jehovah.\"\\nHowever, these should be enough to expose their error.\\n\\n        Now, what about Mormonism\\'s claim that Jesus is \"Jehovah,\" but\\nHe is not \"Elohim?\" It is true that Jesus is \"Jehovah.\" The following\\nScriptures prove this fact:\\n\\n  \"Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] the King of Israel, and his redeemer\\n  the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and\\n  beside me there is no God.

(Ps. 83:13,16,18)\\n\\n        The Bible clearly teaches that \"Jehovah\" is \"Elohim.\" In fact,\\nHe is the only \"Elohim\" there is. He is the \"true,\" the \"living,\" the\\n\"mighty,\" the \"great,\" and the \"everlasting Elohim.\" He is the \"Elohim\"\\nof Israel, of all the kingdoms of the earth, and of the heavens. He is\\nthe Creator who made the heavens and all their host and the earth and\\nall that dwell thereon. \"Jehovah\\'s\" name is \"Elohim of hosts.\" (Amos\\n5:27)\\n\\n        Not only is \"Jehovah,\" \"Elohim,\" but \"Elohim\" is \"Jehovah.\" The\\nBible reveals that \"Elohim\\'s\" name is \"Jah\" (Ps. 68:4), \"Jehovah\" (Ps.\\n83:18), and \"Jehovah of hosts.\" (2 Sam. 6:2; Jer. 32:18)   The nation\\nwhose \"Elohim\" is \"Jehovah\" is blessed. (Ps. 33:12) Clearly, this is not\\nthe \"Jehovah\" and \"Elohim\" of the Mormons.\\n\\n        Another Mormon error regarding \"Elohim\" and \"Jehovah\" is the\\nbelief that \"Elohim,\" not \"Jehovah,\" is the Father of all the spirits,\\nincluding Jesus. In the Articles of Faith by Apostle James E. Talmage,\\n\"A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and The Twelve\" apostles\\nstates that \"God the Eternal Father...\\'Elohim,\\' is the literal Parent\\nof...the spirits of the human race.\" (p. 466) This \"Doctrinal\\nExposition\" also states explicitly that \"Jesus Christ is not the Father\\nof the spirits who have taken or yet shall take bodies upon this earth,\\nfor He is one of them. He is The Son, as they are sons and daughters of\\nElohim.\" (p. 473)\\n\\n        The Apostle Talmage stated that \"_Elohim_...is the name-title of\\nGod the Eternal Father, whose firstborn Son in the spirit is\\n_Jehovah_--\" (Jesus the Christ, p. 38)\\n\\n        The Apostle Bruce R. McConkie stated the following about this\\nmatter: \"...Jehovah-Christ...did in fact create the earth and all forms\\nof plant and animal life on the face thereof. _But when it came to\\nplacing man on earth, there was a change in Creators_. That is, the\\nFather himself became personally involved. All things were created by\\nthe Son, using the power delegated by the Father, except man. _In the\\nspirit and again in the flesh, man was created by the Father_. There was\\nno delegation of authority where the crowning creature of creation was\\nconcerned.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 62) (emphasis added)\\n\\n        Mormon leaders claim that \"Jehovah-Christ\" did not create either\\nman\\'s spirit or his body. They maintain that the Mormon \"Elohim,\" who is\\nthe father, created man both in spirit and body. The Bible reveals the\\ntruth about who created man.\\n\\n  \"And Moses spake unto the LORD [Jehovah], saying,\\n  Let the LORD [Jehovah], the God [Elohim] of the _spirits of all\\n  flesh_, set a man over the congregation. (Num. 27:15-16. See also\\n  16:20-23) (emphasis added)\\n\\n  \"...the LORD [Jehovah], which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth\\n  the foundation of the earth, and _formeth the spirit of man within\\n  him_.

(Jer. 38:16)\\n\\n  \"For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for\\n  the spirit should fail before me, and the _souls which I have\\n  made_....\\n  ...saith the LORD [Jehovah]... (Isa. 57:16,19) (emphasis on \"souls...I\\n  have made\" added)\\n\\n  \"Behold, I am the LORD [Jehovah], the God [Elohim] _of all flesh_...\\n  (Jer. 32:27) (emphasis added)\\n\\n  \"Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], thy redeemer, and he that _formed thee\\n  from the womb_.\\n  I am the LORD [Jehovah] that maketh all things... (Isa. 44:24)\\n  (emphasis added)\\n\\n  \"Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah]...\\n  I have made the earth, and _created man_ upon it... (Isa. 45:11-12)\\n  (emphasis added)\\n\\n  \"...God [Elohim] created man upon the earth...\\n  Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD\\n  [Jehovah] he is God [Elohim]; there is none else beside him.

(Jer. 27:4-5) (most emphasis added)\\n\\n        The Bible reveals that it is \"Jehovah\" who is the \"Elohim of the\\nspirits of all flesh\" and \"of all flesh\" itself, that it was He who\\n\"formed the spirit of man within him,\" that He \"made us this soul\" and\\n\"formed us from the womb.\" He did indeed \"create man.\"\\n\\n        If Mormon leaders are right when they say Jesus is \"Jehovah,\"\\nthen they are wrong when they say he did not create man. If they are\\nright when they say the father is the one who created man, then they are\\nwrong when they say he is not \"Jehovah.\"\\n\\n        Although Mormon leaders teach that Jesus did not create man,\\nMormon scriptures teach that he did. The BoM states the following:\\n\\n  \"Behold, I am Jesus Christ. I am the Father and the Son....\\n  And never have I showed myself unto _man whom I have created_, for\\n  never has man believed in me as thou hast....\\n  Behold, this body, which ye now behold, is the body of my spirit; and\\n  _man have I created_ after the body of my spirit... (Eth. 3:14-16)\\n  (emphasis added)\\n\\n  \"For it is I that taketh upon me the sins of the world; for it is _I\\n  that hath created them_... (Mos. 26:23) (emphasis added)\\n\\n  \"...the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of\\n  Jacob...is that same God who created the heavens and the earth, and\\n  all things that in them are.\\n  Behold _he created Adam_... (Mor. 9:11-12) (emphasis added)\\n\\n        D&C, 93:10 states that \"the worlds were made by him [Christ];\\n_men were made by him_; all things were made by him, and through him,\\nand of him.\" (emphasis added)\\n\\n        Another error by Bruce R. McConkie involving \"Jehovah\" and his\\ncreation is the belief that \"Jehovah\" had \"many\" pre-mortal spirits\\nhelping him create. Included in this alleged group was Joseph Smith, Jr.\\n\\n  \"That he [Christ] was aided in the creation of this earth by \"many of\\n  the noble and great\" spirit children of the Father is evident from\\n  Abraham\\'s writings. Unto those superior spirits Christ said: \"We will\\n  go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these\\n  materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell.\" (Abra.\\n  3:22-24.) Michael or Adam was one of these. Enoch, Noah, Abraham,\\n  Moses, Peter, James, and John, Joseph Smith, and many other \"noble and\\n  great\" ones played a part in the great creative enterprise. (Doctrines\\n  of Salvation, vol. 1, pp. 74-75.) (Mormon Doctrine, p. 169)\\n\\n        The Bible reveals the truth about this matter:\\n\\n  \"Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], thy redeemer, and he that formed thee\\n  from the womb, I am the LORD [Jehovah] that maketh all things; that\\n  stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by\\n  myself. (Isa. 44:24)\\n\\n  \"Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of\\n  the sea. (Job 9:8)\\n\\n        \"Jehovah,\" by Himself, created all things. He had no alleged\\npreexistent spirit helpers assisting Him.\\n\\n        Regarding the Mormon \\'Elohim,\" the Apostle McConkie stated:\\n\"Elohim. plural word though it is, is also used as the exalted\\nname-title of God the Eternal Father, a usage that connotes his\\nsupremacy and omnipotence, he being God above all Gods.\" (Mormon\\nDoctrine, p. 224) He also stated that \"Jesus...is above all save the\\nFather only.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 363)\\n\\n        The Bible states that the One who is God above all so-called\\ngods is the triune God \"Jehovah.\"\\n\\n  \"For the LORD [Jehovah] is a great God [El], and a great King above\\n  all gods [Elohim]. (Ps. 95:3)\\n\\n  \"For thou, LORD [Jehovah], art high above all the earth: thou art\\n  exalted far above all gods [Elohim]. (Ps. 97:9)\\n\\n  \"Now I know that the LORD [Jehovah] is greater than all gods\\n  [Elohim]... (Exod. 18:11. See also Ps. 135:5; Deut. 10:17)\\n\\n        If Mormon leaders are right when they say \"Jehovah\" is god the\\nson and \"Elohim\" is god the father, these verses from the Bible would be\\nteaching that the Mormon son is above his father. However, as McConkie\\nclearly stated, Mormons believe \"Elohim\" the father, not \"Jehovah\" the\\nson, is the \"God above all Gods\" -- that Jesus is above all except the\\nfather; yet the Bible teaches that \"Jehovah\" is above all \"Elohim.\"\\n\\n        At a BYU Dev. on March 2, 1982, Bruce R. McConkie made the\\nfollowing remark about praying to Jesus:\\n\\n  \"Another peril is that those so involved often begin to pray directly\\n  to Christ because of some special friendship they feel has been\\n  developed....\\n  This is plain sectarian nonsense. Our prayers are addressed to the\\n  Father, and to him only....\\n  ...Perfect prayer is addressed to the Father, in the name of the Son;\\n  it is uttered by the power of the Holy Ghost... (Our Relationship With\\n  the Lord, pp. 19-20)\\n\\n        McConkie states on p. 335 of his book Promised Messiah that the\\nMormons \"pray to the Father, not the Son...\" On p. 306 of the same book\\nMcConkie states that \"Christ [the Son] is Jehovah.\" This is important to\\nremember, because although McConkie said prayer is not to be offered to\\nthe Mormon Christ who is \"Jehovah,\" the Bible states repeatedly in the\\nOT that people prayed to \"Jehovah,\" and He not only heard those prayers,\\nbut He accepted them as valid requests. The following is but a small\\nsample of the vast number of times people prayed to \"Jehovah.\"\\n\\n  \"In my distress I called upon the LORD [Jehovah], and cried unto my\\n  God [Elohim]: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came\\n  before him, even into his ears. (Ps. 18:6)\\n\\n  \"And the LORD [Jehovah] said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy\\n  supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this\\n  house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine\\n  eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually. (1 Kin. 9:3)\\n\\n  \"And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our\\n  supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the LORD\\n  [Jehovah] thy God [Elohim], even for all this remnant... (Jer. 42:2)\\n\\n  \"O LORD [Jehovah], I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to\\n  the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who\\n  desire to fear thy name... (Neh. 1:11)\\n\\n  \"And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this\\n  prayer and supplication unto the LORD [Jehovah], he arose from before\\n  the altar of the LORD [Jehovah], from kneeling on his knees with his\\n  hands spread up to heaven. (1 Kin. 8:54)\\n\\n  \"He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed\\n  unto the LORD [Jehovah]. (2 Kin. 4:33)\\n\\n  \"Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], the God\\n  [Elohim] of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy\\n  tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years.

(Ps. 32:5-6)\\n\\n        Notice above in Ps. 32:6 that the \"godly\" pray to \"Jehovah.\"\\nAccording to McConkie and other Mormon leaders, that is Christ the very\\none to whom McConkie said people should not pray.\\n\\n        The Bible reveals there is only one true \"Elohim,\" and His name\\nis \"Jehovah.\" All other \"Elohim\" are false. They are idols that cause\\ntheir followers to commit adultery against the true \"Elohim\" and\\nidolatry.\\n\\n  \"For the LORD [Jehovah] is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to\\n  be feared above all gods [Elohim].\\n  For all the gods [Elohim] of the nations are idols: but the LORD\\n  [Jehovah] made the heavens.

Therefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know, I\\n  will cause them to know mine hand and my might; and they shall know\\n  that my name is the LORD [Jehovah]. ( Jer. 16:20-21)\\n\\n  \"And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD [Jehovah], choose you\\n  this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods [Elohim] which your\\n  fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods\\n  [Elohim] of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my\\n  house, we will serve the LORD [Jehovah].\\n  And the people answered and said, God [Elohim] forbid that we should\\n  forsake the LORD [Jehovah], to serve other gods [Elohim]. (Josh.\\n  24:15-16)\\n\\n        These verses teach that the only true, living \"Elohim\" in heaven\\nand on earth is \"Jehovah\" -- the triune God who made heaven and earth\\nand all therein.\\n\\n        \"Jehovah\" is greater than any \"Elohim,\" because all other\\n\"Elohim\" are idols. The reality behind them is demonic. (Deut. 32:17)\\n\"Jehovah Elohim\" has given explicit warnings and guidelines regarding\\nthese false \"Elohim.\" He told His people not to have any \"Elohim\" but\\nHim. He told the people that if they left Him for the false \"Elohim,\"\\nthose \"Elohim\" would be a snare to them, and they would be hurt and\\nwould perish. He warned the people to \"take heed\" that their \"heart be\\nnot deceived\" into worshiping, serving, swearing by, and making\\ncovenants with false \"Elohim.\" \"Jehovah Elohim\" told His people He would\\neventually judge all false \"Elohim\" and their followers.\\n\\n        Despite these warnings and guidelines, \"Elohim\\'s\" covenant\\npeople forsook Him and believed in and worshiped the false \"Elohim\\'s\" of\\nthe people they came in contact with. Ju. 10:6 states that \"the children\\nof Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD [Jehovah] and served\\nBaalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods [Elohim] of Syria, and the gods\\n[Elohim] of Zidon, and the gods [Elohim] of Moab, and the gods [Elohim]\\nof the children of Ammon, and the gods [Elohim] of the Philistines, and\\nforsook the LORD [Jehovah], and served not him.\"\\n\\n        This examination has shown that the \"Elohim\" of Mormonism, like\\nthe \"Elohim\" in Ju. 10:6 is not the true \"Jehovah Elohim.\" Therefore,\\nthe people who leave the true \"Elohim\" for the Mormon \"Elohim\" will do\\n\"evil...in the sight of the LORD [Jehovah].\"\\n\\n        Although McConkie attacked Christians for their belief in a\\ntriune God who is Spirit and for their belief that God the Father\\n[Jehovah] sent His Son into the world, these beliefs are true. God is\\ntriune; He is Spirit; He is \"Jehovah;\" and He did send His Son into the\\nworld to redeem mankind.\\n\\n        It is obvious from this examination that it is not the\\nChristians who \"thrash around in...darkness\" about who \"Elohim\" and\\n\"Jehovah\" are. One wonders what \"Holy Writ\" McConkie had in mind when he\\nstated that it attests to the fact that \"Elohim is the Father, and that\\nJehovah is the Son.\" He certainly did not mean the Bible which teaches\\nthat the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are all the one \"Jehovah Elohim.\"\\nHe apparently did not mean the D&C either, because chapter 109, verses\\n1,4,9-10, 14,19,22,24,29,34,42,47,56,68,77 refer to the Father as\\n\"Jehovah.\"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\n        Obviously Joseph Fielding Smith\\'s statement that the Mormons\\n\"have a clear and perfect understanding of the nature of God\" (Doctrines\\nof Salvation, 1:279) is not accurate. The Mormon gods are not the true\\nGod as Mormonism claims, but are idols which cause their followers to\\ncommit adultery against God and idolatry.\\n\\n        In answer to Jesus\\' question, \"But whom say ye that I am,\"\\nMormons say Jesus is someone different from the Jesus who is revealed in\\nthe Bible and whom the apostles preached. Therefore, anyone trusting in\\nthe Mormon Jesus is believing in \"another Jesus\" whom Paul warned about.\\n\\n        Bernard P. Brockbank, of the First Quorum of the Seventy,\\nadmitted in the May 1977 issue of The Ensign, a Mormon publication, that\\nthe Mormon Jesus is different from the Christian Jesus. He stated that\\n\"it is true that many of the Christian churches worship a different\\nJesus Christ than is worshipped by the Mormons or The Church of Jesus\\nChrist of Latter-day Saints.\" (p. 26)\\n\\n        The people who believe in the Mormon Jesus are committing\\nadultery against God and idolatry. They do not have the Son; therefore,\\nthey do not have the Father, and they do not have eternal life. As the\\nApostle Bruce R. McConkie rightly stated: \"Salvation comes only by\\nworshiping the true God.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 163) McConkie also\\nrightly stated that \"the mere worship of a god who has the proper\\nscriptural names does not assure one that he is worshiping the true and\\nliving God,\" because the \"true names of Deity\" can be applied to \"false\\nconcepts of God.\" (Mormon Doctrine, p. 270) Remember that the Apostle\\nStephen L. Richards admitted that Joseph Smith, Jr., gave \"a new\\nconception of God and the Godhead.\" (Contributions of Joseph Smith, p.\\n1)\\n\\n        It is important for the people who have left the true triune God\\nrevealed in the Bible to repent and return to Him. They must forsake the\\nsins of idolatry and adultery which they are committing in Mormonism.\\nThe Bible says:\\n\\n  \"...all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, and they that depart from\\n  me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the LORD\\n  [Jehovah], the fountain of living waters. (Jer. 17:13)\\n\\n  \"And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD [Jehovah] thy God\\n  [Elohim], and walk after other gods [Elohim], and serve them, and\\n  worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely\\n  perish. (Deut. 8:19)\\n\\n  \"Thou shalt make no covenant with...their gods [Elohim]. (Exod. 23:32)\\n\\n  \"...Put away the strange gods [Elohim] that are among you, and be\\n  clean, and change your garments. (Gen. 35:2)\\n\\n  \"...flee from idolatry. (1 Cor. 10:14)\\n\\n        It is necessary that Christians heed the warnings of the Bible.\\nIf they do, they will not fall into the sins of adultery against God and\\nidolatry. Remember, to know the \"only true God\" is eternal life. (John\\n17:3)\\n\\n  \"...their gods [Elohim] shall be a snare unto you.\" (Ju. 2:3. See also\\n  Exod. 23:32-33)\\n\\n\\n\\n' => soc.religion.christian \n",

I\\ndecided to implement an animated cursor (using 6 created cursors) by calling\\nXDefineCursor from a SIG_ALRM signal handler. This is used to indicate we are\\nwaiting for a operator request to complete.

XDrawString\\nwas doing a bcopy (presumably an internal structure) when the XDefineCursor\\nwas called. Presumably the (internal) structure that XDrawString was manipulating\\nwas not in a stable state and sent XDefineCursor to where it shouldn't have been.\\n\\nHas anyone else experienced this?

And if you do get\\nthe training, the doctors monopoly might block your getting of a\\nlicence because there is already someone in the business and who\\ncannot fill his/her appointment book.

The competition is fake if it exists at all, because they\\'re\\nall interlinked.  Look in Der Spiegel or Stern (my girlfriend is in\\nour German department  and her uncle is a private practicioner in\\nSaarbrucken) ... no ads for health insurance.  While Canada organizes\\nby province, Germany organizes the paperwork around big corporations\\nand regional offices.   But remember that we have provinces that have\\nthe same population as some major German corporations.  Germans have\\npublic health insurance, just that it is brokered by smaller entities\\n(actually, brokerage of basic by private firms who\\'ll sell extra\\ninsurance to fill out their policies, sort of a voucher system,\\nwas one of the first ideas floated in Canada, too).\\n\\nRemember, the Germans don\\'t have HMO\\'s ... a telling sign, \\'cos\\nRochester does and they\\'re also a company town.\\n\\n>But there was a Washington Post article recently about that that said\\n>Canadian doctors often use myelograms instead of MRIs, which require\\n>spinal injections and can cause seizures and headaches.

Kaliski Jr. \\\\\\\\\\n{\\\\tt burt@rsa.com} \\\\and\\nMatthew J.B. Robshaw \\\\\\\\\\n{\\\\tt matt@rsa.com} \\\\and\\nRSA Laboratories \\\\\\\\\\n100 Marine Parkway \\\\\\\\\\nRedwood City, CA  94065}\\n\\\\date{April 23, 1993}\\n\\n\\\\maketitle\\n\\nA message-digest algorithm maps a message of arbitrary length to a\\n``digest'' of fixed length, and has three properties: Computing the\\ndigest is easy, finding a message with a given\\ndigest---``inversion''---is hard, and finding two messages with the\\nsame digest---``collision''---is also hard. Message-digest algorithms\\nhave many applications, including digital signatures and message\\nauthentication.\\n\\nRSA Data Security's MD5 message-digest algorithm, developed by Ron\\nRivest \\\\cite{rfc-md5}, maps a message to a 128-bit message digest.\\nComputing the digest of a one-megabyte message takes as little as a\\nsecond.  While no message-digest algorithm can yet be {\\\\em proved}\\nsecure, MD5 is believed to be at least as good as any other that maps\\nto a 128-bit digest.  Inversion should take about $2^{128}$\\noperations, and collision should take about $2^{64}$ operations.  No\\none has found a faster approach to inversion or collision.\\n\\nRecent work by den Boer and Bosselaers \\\\cite{den-boer-md5} presents\\na special kind of ``pseudocollision'' in MD5's\\ninternal compression function, which maps\\na 512-bit message block $x$ and a\\n128-bit input state $s$ to a 128-bit output\\nstate. They show how to find a message block $x$\\nand two related input states $s_1$ and $s_2$ that yield the same\\noutput state: $f(x,s_1)$ = $f(x,s_2)$. Their well-thought approach\\nexploits structural properties of the collision function to find \\na pseudocollision in about $2^{16}$ operations, much less than one\\nwould expect.\\n\\nPractical implications of this pseudocollision work to the security of\\nMD5 are not evident. While a real collision in MD5 implies a\\npseudocollision (or a ``pseudo-inversion''), a\\npseudocollision need not imply a real collision. Indeed, a real\\ncollision, since it involves two different messages, would almost\\nalways involve {\\\\em different} message blocks $x_1$ and $x_2$ such that\\n$f(x_1,s_1) = f(x_2,s_2)$, but the pseudocollisions have the same\\nmessage blocks. Moreover, the input states $s_1$ and $s_2$ would\\ngenerally be unrelated, but the pseudocollisions' input states are\\nthe same except for four bits.  There does not seem to be any way to\\nextend den Boer and Bosselaers' approach to anything beyond the\\nspecial pseudocollisions, a limitation they readily admit.\\n\\nIt is reasonable, therefore, to believe that MD5 remains secure. While den\\nBoer and Bosselaers have found interesting structural properties in\\nMD5, the properties seem only to lead to special pseudocollisions\\nand not anything approaching real collisions. Further research, of\\ncourse, will give a better understanding of the strengths of MD5 and\\nother message-digest algorithms, with the eventual hope that\\nsuch algorithms can, in some sense, be proved secure.\\n\\n\\\\bibliographystyle{plain}\\n\\\\begin{thebibliography}{1}\\n\\n\\\\bibitem{den-boer-md5}\\nBert den~Boer and Antoon Bosselaers.\\n\\\\newblock Collisions for the compression function of {MD5}.\\n\\\\newblock In {\\\\it Advances in Cryptology --- Eurocrypt '93}, 1993.\\n\\\\newblock Preprint.\\n\\n\\\\bibitem{rfc-md5}\\nR.L.

Looking at the motherboard, I can see\\nthat 2 resistors have been snipped off where it says \"256Kb path -\\n1 row\". I assume that was done when the first 1MB SIMMs were added.\\n\\nSo, my question is: Are there any other resistors that need snipping? \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor, Do I have bum SIMMs which need to be exchanged?\\n\\nAny and all advice will be appreciated.\\n\\nChris Gatenby\\ngatenb@mrisun.med.yale.edu\\n' => sci.crypt \n",

I\\'d like to give some feedback based on\\nreal life experince.  I keep the Valentine-1 in advanced logic mode\\nand it rarely lights up as a Christmas tree.  The only time it does\\nis when I am in the middle of a major shopping area and then it makes\\nsense that is does since there are >= 8 sources coming from many different\\ndirections.  I have found the Valentine-1 to be consistent in its\\nreporting of bogeys regardless of any moving cars in the area.\\n\\nI have found the directional indication to be very useful.  In one case\\nthere was two radar traps set up within one mile of each other.  As I\\npassed the first radar trap, the direction indication changed.  Then\\nthe detector was set off again pointing in the forward direction.  With\\nother radar detectors I would have assumed that this was due to a reflection.\\nBut with the Valentine-1 I knew there was a high probability that there\\nwas another trap.  And there was!\\n\\nOn other occasions, the directional helped discern a false alarm from\\na true alarm.  For example, as I pass a source, the direction indicator\\nchanges.  The directional also allows me to focus my attention as to where\\nthe signal might be coming from instead of having to look all over the \\nplace.  When a car is approaching me from the rear with a detector\\nthat leaks, I can tell that the signal is coming from the rear and as the\\ncar passes me I can verify the source.  With other detectors, I would\\nhave been unable to do this and would have had to assume that there was a radar\\ntrap when there was none.\\n\\nI\\'ve had the Valentine-1 for several months now and find its added features\\nto be useful and not gimmicks.\\n\\n                                       -Barry\\n-- \\n-----                                                                   --------\\nBarry Frishberg                                             blf@apollo.ch.hp.com\\nChelmsford-UK Expert Center                                      508/TN 436-4319\\nChelmsford, MA                                                 \\n' => rec.autos \n",

ABC aired a report including the 911 tapes \\nfrom Monday. The FBI called 911 within 4 minutes of the fire\\'s breakout. \\nUnfortunately, dispatch of vehicles outside the Waco city limits \\nrequired approval of a deputy chief, who was not available (literally \\nout to lunch?); the 911 operator desperately called around to local \\ncommunity volunteer fire departments to get something out there. By \\nthe time trucks arrived 27 minutes later, the whole complex was aflame \\nand it was clearly too little, too late; there were just two pumpers \\nand no water supply. The FBI made another call requesting a tank truck, \\nbut the Waco department apparently depended on hydrants and did not \\nhave one. Though clearly unwilling to risk firemen\\'s lives in the \\nline of fire, it seems they might have done so had there been sufficient \\nequipment and water to make a difference.\\n\\nThey even aired a tape of a woman who called Waco 911 from Georgia \\nasking if anything was being done. Civic-minded, but probably \\nirresponsible; if everyone watching television did that, no local \\ncalls could get through.\\n\\nABC also aired the comments of an independent fire investigator who \\nviewed tapes from more than one side of the compound (not just the \\nstandard \"pool shot\"), and agreed that the fire a) must have been \\nstarted in at least 3 places, and b) must have had an accelerant \\nto spread so fast.\\n\\nNeither of these is conclusive proof that the Koresh crowd offed \\nthemselves more than the FBI offed them, but it\\'s a heck of a lot \\nstronger proof than some of the \"theories\" floating around the net.\\n\\nScore 2 FBI, 0 Branch Davidians.

I\\'ve talked with him, though much he likes to hide (\"mystery\"). \\nSpecial handshakes and all.  When he first started trying to \"evangelize\" me,\\nhe told me all kinds on special this, and special that.  Here is truely a\\n\"mystery\" religion.  THere is the public side with motorcyle mania and\\nchildrens hospitals and then there is the priviate side that only the highest\\ndegree mason every learns of.\\n>\\n>     Second, worship of Osiris is not, nor has it ever been, a part of\\n>Masonic practice (we are strictly non-denominational).\\n>\\nI haven\\'t read it, but the literature that is offered by the silver haired\\napologist (can\\'t remember his name) on TV, didn\\'t exactly come to this same\\nconclusion.  \\n\\n\"Khons, the son of the great goddess-mother, seems to have been gernaerally\\nrepresented as a full-grown god. The Babylonian divinity was also represented\\nvery frequently in Egupt in the very same wayas in the land of his nativity\\n-i.e. as a child in his mother\\'s arems.  THis was the way in which Osiris, \\'the\\nson, the husband of his mother,\\' was often exhibited, and what we learn of this\\ngod, equally as in the case of Khonso, shows that in his original he was none\\nother than Nimrod.  It is admitted that the secret system of Free Masonry was\\noriginally founded on the Mysteries of the Egyptian Isis, the goddess-mother,\\nor wife of Osiris.  But what could have led to the union of a Masonic body with\\nthese Mysteries, had they not had particular reference to architecture, and had\\nthe god who was worshipped in them not been celebrated for his success in\\nperfecting the arts of fortification and building?  Now, if such were the case,\\nconsidering the relation in which, as we have already seen, Egypt stood to\\nBabylon, who would naturally be liiked up to there as the great patron of the\\nMasonic art?  The strong presumption is, that Nimrod must have been the man. \\nHe was the first that gained faim in this way.  As the child of the Babylonian\\ngoddess-mother, he was worshipped in the character of Ala mahozim, \\'The God of\\nFortification.\\'  Osiris, the child of the Egyptian Modonna, was equally\\ncelebrated as \\'the strong chief of the buildings.\\'  THis strong chief of the\\nbuildings was origninally worshipped in Egypt with every physicall\\ncharacteristic of Nimrod.  I have already noticed the fact that Nimrod, as the\\nson of Cush, was a negro.  Now, there was a tradition in Egypt, recorded by\\nPlutarch, that \\'Osiris was black\\'.......\"  Hislop\\n\\nIt was like a cold slap to my face, when my wifes uncle brought out his\\ncerimonial dress and it was leopard skin.  I mean real leopard skin.   He told\\nme that only the highest of degrees wore the leopard skin.  (The reason that he\\nstarted telling me all this was that he had just been given a couple of months\\nto live and my wife had led him to a saving faith in Christ and he immediately\\nrepented from \\'mysteries\\' of the lodge!)\\n\\nNimr-rod from Nimr, a \"leopard,\" and rada or rad \"To subdue.\"  It is a\\nuniversal principle in all idolatries, that the high priest wears the insignia\\nof the god he serves.  Any representation of Osiris usually show the wearing of\\nsome leopard.  It is interesting that the Druids of Britian also show, or\\nshould I say hide, this representation.  They, however, worshipped the \"spotted\\ncow\".\\n\\nI\\'ll stand by my statements.  Masonry is of the \"mystery\" religions that all\\nfind their source in Babylon, the great harlot. Sorry Peter,  I do not mean to\\nbe a \"cold slap to the face\" but there is to much evidence to the contrary that\\nMasonry doesn\\'t find its origins in Egypt.  Of the Masons I have personally\\ntalked to, all refered to Egypt as their origin.  Why are you now separating\\nyourself from this which not many years ago, was freely admitted?\\n\\n-Rex\\n' => soc.religion.christian \n",

If the investigation indicates a\\n   likelihood that the alleged private revelation is in fact from God,\\n   it will be approved.  That means that it can be preached in the\\n   Church.  However, it is still true that no one is required to\\n   believe that it came from God.

(I\\n   suspect that few if any Catholics do reject Fatima and Lourdes, but\\n   if any do their rejection of them does not mean they are not\\n   orthodox Catholics in good standing.)\\n\\nIt may be a bit much to say that a Catholic is free to deny what\\nhappened at Fatima.  That\\'s a bit strong, it is sort of like saying\\nthat a Catholic is free to deny that Hong Kong exists.  What a\\nCatholic *is* free to do is to deny the truth of Fatima, without being\\ncalled a heretic.  You can be labeled other things for such an\\noffense, but not a heretic.\\n\\nTheologians make a basic distinction as far as the degree of assent\\none must give to events like Fatima and Lourdes.  Things revealed by\\nGod through Jesus Christ or His Apostles must be given the assent due\\nto a revelation of God: total and unswerving.  Fatima and Lourdes\\ndemand our assent as much as any other well-attested event in human\\nhistory.  Perhaps a bit more, given the approval of the Church.\\n\\n\"Approval\" of an apparition by the Church principally means that\\nwhatever happened was in harmony with the Catholic Faith.\\n\\nI personally think of private revelations as our Lord\\'s way of telling\\nus what to do at particular periods in history.

Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he\\nremained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:\\n\\n\"Galactic Pot-Healer\"\\nA fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a\\nremote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the\\ndeity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is\\nunable to comply.

He is accompanied by his dogmatic and\\ndismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.\\n\\n\"The Divine Invasion\"\\nGod invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from\\nanother star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be\\nassisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.\\n\\nMARGARET ATWOOD\\n\\n\"The Handmaid\\'s Tale\"\\nA story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously\\nassassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it\\n\"right\" again.  The book is the diary of a woman\\'s life as she tries to live\\nunder the new Christian theocracy.  Women\\'s right to own property is revoked,\\nand their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the\\nradio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished\\nretroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the \"old world\" are\\nhunted down and hanged.  Atwood\\'s writing style is difficult to get used to\\nat first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.\\n\\nVARIOUS AUTHORS\\n\\n\"The Bible\"\\nThis somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.

Focusses on the period 1770-1900, and while considering France\\nand Britain the emphasis is on American, and particularly New England\\ndevelopments.  \"Neither a religious history of secularization or atheism,\\nWithout God, Without Creed is, rather, the intellectual history of the fate\\nof a single idea, the belief that God exists.\" \\n316 pages.

In this\\nwork, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the\\nexistence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely\\nupon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and\\naesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were\\ndecisively rejected in Mackie\\'s \"The Miracle of Theism\".  In the revised\\nedition of \"The Existence of God\", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he\\nmakes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.\\n\\nJ. L. MACKIE\\n\\n\"The Miracle of Theism\", Oxford\\nThis (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal\\narguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical\\nphilosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through\\nthe moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements\\nof the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those\\npositions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,\\nsuch as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as \"replacements for\\nGod\" such as Lelie\\'s axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less\\nformalistic and better written than Martin\\'s works, and refreshingly direct\\nwhen compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.\\n\\nJAMES A.

But many viruses \\nmutate and reexposure to the new strain requires another immune response(\\nnew antibody production).  In addition, antibody levels tend to decline \\nwith time and re-innoculation is needed to keep the antibody levels high.\\nChronic overstimulation of the immune response can lead to immunosupression \\nbut this is rare and very unlikely to occur in children.\\n\\n> -- Does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long\\n> term effects?\\n\\nYes, chronic use of antibiotics can have an adverse effect on the good \\nbacteria that are supposed to be present in and on the body.  Health effects \\nof this depletion of the good bacteria is a very hotly debated topic in the \\nmedical community with most physicians seeming to discount any health effects \\nof chronic antibiotic use( a view that I do not support).\\n \\n> -- How does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than\\n> normal, and what does one do about it?\\n\\nChronic infection in an adult or a child needs to be worked up( in my \\nopinion).  But most physicians feel that chronic infection in a child is \\nnormal because of both exposure and lack of prior immunity to many \\ninfectious diseases.  I do not share this view and there are some \\nphysicians who also suspect that diet plays a big role in infection \\nfrequency and severity.  Exposure to an infectious agent does not have to \\nresult in a severe infection.  A strong immune response can minimize the \\nlength of time needed to deal with the infection as well as the symptoms \\nassociated with the infection.\\n\\n> -- Is there any way to build immunity and resistance?\\n\\nThere are five major nutrients that are responsible for a good strong \\nimmune response to infectious agents.  They are: protein, vitamin C, \\nvitamin A, iron and zinc.  The American diet is not low in protein so this \\nis rarely a problem.  But vitamin A, vitamin C, iron and zinc are often low \\nand this lack of an adequate pool(nutrient reserve) can impair the immune \\nresponse.  Iron is know to be low in most kids(as is vitamin A).  There are \\ndistinct biochemical tests that can be run to check the status of each of \\nthese nutrients in a patient who is having a problem with chronic severe \\ninfection.  Serum ferritin for iron status, dark adaptation for vitamin A \\nstatus, red blood cell zinc for zinc status and leckocyte ascorbate for \\nvitamin C status.  I have attempted to work up posts on these five \\nnutrients and their role in infection for this news group as well as the \\nothers that I participate in.  I can e-mail you what I\\'ve worked up so far.\\nBut my best advice to you is to try to find a physician who recognizes the \\ncritical role that diet plays in the human immune response.  You may also \\nbe able to get help from a nutritionist.  Anyone can call themselves a \\nnutritionist so you have to be very carefull.  You want to find someone(\\nlike myself) who has had some formal training and education in nutrition.\\nMany Ph.D. programs in the U.S. now offer degrees in Nutrition and that\\'s \\nwhat you need to look for.  Some dieticians will also call themselves \\nnutritionists but most dieticians have not had the biochemical training \\nneeded to run specialized nutritional assessment tests.

Atlanta's ABC has declined to pick up any\\nplayoff games till May9. And even when they show the games on MAy9 and May16,\\nthey will continue to skip the first half hour of the telecast. I know this\\nis still a better situation compared to rest of Georgia, Alabama, etc., but\\nit is still pretty annoying. At least in PIttsburgh, we had a network preemptionchannel which showed all netwoork shows prempted by the local affiliate.\\n\\n\\nI asked them what their problem was. I told them that a local 1.9 rating was\\nnot that bad considering it was the first NHL game shown after a long time\\nwithout much promotion. Besides, their syndicated programming in the afternoon\\nis usually low rated. So what did they have to lose by showing NHL playoffs.\\nShe told me that they had contractual obligations. I asked her if golf\\nwas shown oin ABC, would contractual obligations come in the way. And how come\\ncontractual obligations didn't come in the way of last week's telecast? She\\nthen couldn't give me a coherent answer.\\n\\n\\nAlso, I added that Atlanta had one of the highest neutral site game\\nattendances and that the demographics were good. I think ABC and other networks\\nshould begin to tie their high rated programs like Roseanne in with\\n thier sports programming.\\nI hope that everyone in Atlanta who reads this bboard calls WSB 2 and complain\\nbitterlyt about this. Tell them you will stop watching their news telecasts\\nsince they seem to be very unprofessional in handling this situation.\\n\\nThe lady did not seem to settle on a single reason. Sometimes, the reason\\nis low ratings. Then another time, she says contractual obligations.\\n\" => talk.politics.mideast \n",

Anti-fighting people may want to skip this post.)\\n\\nTopics\\n------\\n\\nDon\\'s Tie, Grant Fuhr, Penalties, Wings vs Leafs, Fighting, Dale Hunter.\\n\\nEpisode Summary\\n---------------\\n\\nThis episode began with the camera zoomed in on Don\\'s tie. Don was\\npointing out the characters on the tie... Bugs Bunny, Foghorn Leghorn,\\nand Yosemite Sam (who Don called Lanny Macdonald.)\\n\\nRon Maclean began by mentioning that Don was almost evicted from a\\nhotel where he was watching the previous night\\'s games, because of\\nall the yelling and cheering he was doing over the play of Hunter\\nand Fuhr.\\n\\nDon began to praise Fuhr, calling him the \"greatest goalie\", and\\nsaid that he\\'s winning the series against Boston all by himself.\\nHe then showed clips from earlier episodes (Nov. 14, Jan. 16) when\\nFuhr was still with the Leafs, and Don advised \"Don\\'t Trade Fuhr!\"\\n\\nDon went on to predict that if Buffalo gets by Boston, it would\\nbe Fuhr who wins the series. Muckler took a lot of heat for the\\ntrade, but Don feels Muckler\\'s been vindicated.\\n\\nThe next topic involved how playoff games are being ruined by\\ntoo many penalty calls. He showed a clip from a Winnipeg-Vancouver\\ngame, where Domi hit a Vancouver player, and was given a 2 min. penalty.\\nRon said that it was called a penalty because his stick was involved,\\nbut Don stuck with the opinion that it was a good hit, with Domi\\nhitting the Vancouver player with his shoulder. Don: \"Its sad what\\nthey\\'re doing for hockey... a 5 minute penalty for a nosebleed.\"\\n\\nNext, they went to the playoff series between Detroit and Toronto.\\nPeople in Detroit were calling Wendel Clarke \"Wendy\" for not fighting.\\nHowever, Don pointed out that Probert was not fighting either.\\n\\nThis lead Don into a tirad about fighting and stickwork, and how\\nbanning fighting leads to more high sticking: \"It\\'s like college\\nhockey... The little wee guy with the visor is brave as anybody.\\nThat\\'s why you\\'re seeing so much stickwork. Because they know you\\nwon\\'t drop your gloves and give them a shot. The rules are made\\nby people who don\\'t know what\\'s going on in hockey\".\\n\\nThe final topic Don discussed was Dale Hunter. Don pointed out\\nthat he was leading the league in goals, and showed a clip\\nof Hunter from a previous game. When he was younger, Hunter was\\ntaught to \"play to win\", which differs from today\\'s idea of\\njust letting kids have fun.\\n\\nAt then end of the episode, they showed a clip from a coach\\'s\\ncorner, with the tape on fast forward, so that Don sounded like\\none of the chipmunks.\\n\\nRating\\n------\\nTypical anti-fighting posturing, not too much humour, but some\\ngood quotes.\\n\\nI\\'d give it a 7.0 out of 10.\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n   \\\\  \\\\                   |Allan Sullivan (allan@cs.ualberta.ca)\\n    \\\\  \\\\                  |Department of Computing Science,\\n     \\\\  \\\\_______          |University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.\\n      \\\\    ###  \\\\     _   |---------------------------------------------------\\n       \\\\___###___\\\\   (_)  |My opinions are mine and mine alone.\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\"It is amazing how much can be accomplished if no one cares who gets the\\n credit...\"          - U. of A.

I\\'ll tell you \\nwhat we\\'ve found and the systems we\\'ve worked out.\\n\\n- On starts, accelerate MUCH slower than usual.  It\\'s tough for the rider\\nto judge how scary fast acceleration is, because we\\'re holding onto something\\nand leaning forward.  Remember this.\\n\\n- On turns, have her lean forward and at the same angle as you (normally \\nthis means she isn\\'t leaning at all.)  It\\'s very disconcerting to be leaned\\nover and have your passenger leaning so that they\\'re sitting straight up.\\nMuch balance is lost and this can be dangerous.\\n\\n- On slowing and stopping, do so MUCH slower than usual.  Again, it\\'s tough \\nfor the rider to judge how scary fast deceleration is, because we\\'re holding \\nonto something and leaning forward.  However, you\\'ll figure it out fast\\nbecause braking too fast will shove the passenger forward into you, which \\nshoves you into the tank at an inopportune location.\\n\\n- Generally, have the passenger keep her knees against you and the bike, not \\nout wide.  This helps balance and gives her somegrip.\\n\\n- When you passenger is in fear, she will squeeze her knees against you.\\nNormally this means \"slow down, and do it now!\".  \\n\\n\\n> turning so she leans *with* me, but what else?  Are there traditional\\n> signals for SLOW DOWN!! or GO FASTER!! or I HAFTA GO PEE!! etc.???\\n\\nWe only have a couple signals.  \"Slow down\" is her either tapping me on \\nthe back, or slapping my helmet with all her might.  Depends on the urgency\\nof the matter :-)\\n\\n\"Turn here\" is done by her pointing in the direction of an exit.  This is\\nalso the sign for \"cool!  Look at that.\"  \"I hafta pee\" is the same sign\\nas \"turn here\".  \"I\\'m hungry\" is the same sign.  \"Go faster\" is usually\\ndone by her jumping up and down on her pegs in glee.  I usually see \"slow\\ndown\" more often than \"go faster\".\\n \\n> I really want this to be a positive experience for us both, mainly so that\\n> she\\'ll want to go with me again, so any help will be appreciated...\\n\\nThe best thing to do before the ride is to talk to a riding buddy, and \\npillion on his or her bike.  It\\'s incredibly frustrating, because you\\'re \\nin almost no control.  Now, multiply that feeling times ten, because\\nyou as a rider know what your bike will do, and your passenger will likely\\nfeel you\\'re about to scrape hard parts all the time, or lock up the brakes\\nat any moment, or go careening off the edge of a volcanic mountain, etc.  \\nPillioning yourself is good training to take somebody on your pillion pad.\\n\\nAlso, remember that it\\'s much more draining and tiring to ride 2-up\\nthan by yourself, because you\\'re concentrating on much more, and\\n\"in the Zen of the moment\" less.

JPEG is designed for compressing either\\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\\ndrawings.\\n\\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\\nrespectively.\\n\\nJPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn\\'t\\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\\nthe fact that small color details aren\\'t perceived as well as small details\\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\\ninvisible to the eye.\\n\\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\\nfiles if you don\\'t mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\\naren\\'t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\\n\\n\\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\\n\\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\\n\\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\\n\\nIf your viewing software doesn\\'t support JPEG directly, you\\'ll have to\\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\\nJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\\nextra time to decompress the file.  I\\'ll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\\n\\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\\n\\n\\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\\n\\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\\n\\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\\ngray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don\\'t have 24-bit display\\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\\n\\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\\nby GIF.  JPEG can\\'t squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\\n\\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\\nparticularly objectionable with text that\\'s only a few pixels high.\\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don\\'t JPEG it.\\n\\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\\n\\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\\n\\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\\na GIF, you\\'ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you\\'ll have to make for yourself.\\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\\nconvert well.\\n\\n\\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\\n\\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B.\\n\\nFile\\t   Size in bytes\\t\\tComments\\n\\nship.ppm\\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\\n\\t\\t\\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\\nship.ppm.Z\\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\\n\\t\\t\\t compress doesn\\'t accomplish a lot, you\\'ll note.\\n\\t\\t\\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\\nship.gif\\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\\n\\t\\t\\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color\\n\\t\\t\\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)\\n\\nship.jpg95\\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\\n\\t\\t\\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\\nship.jpg75\\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\\n\\t\\t\\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\\nship.jpg50\\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50\\n\\t\\t\\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look\\n\\t\\t\\t for, you could tell it\\'s been JPEGed without seeing\\n\\t\\t\\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many\\n\\t\\t\\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\\nship.jpg25\\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\\n\\t\\t\\t JPEG\\'s characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent\\n\\t\\t\\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\\n\\t\\t\\t Still, I\\'ve seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\\n\\t\\t\\t of poorer image quality than this.\\nship.jpg5o\\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\\n\\t\\t\\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\\n\\t\\t\\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\\n\\t\\t\\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\\n\\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that\\'s a factor of four or five smaller\\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\\nratio for real-world scenes.\\n\\n\\n[5]  What are good \"quality\" settings for JPEG?\\n\\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\\nthe meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the\\ninformation\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\\nit\\'s not a percentage of anything.\\n\\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\\n\\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\\n\\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\\n\\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".\\n\\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\\nquality scale.  Some programs don\\'t even provide a numeric scale, just\\n\"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choices.)\\n\\n\\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\\n\\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\\nIf you don\\'t know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\".\\n(If you don\\'t have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\\nsame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\\n\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\" in the body.  The \"Anonymous FTP\\nList FAQ\" may also be helpful --- it\\'s usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in\\nthe news.answers archive.\\n\\nNOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple\\nmonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.\\n\\n\\n[6A]  If you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc:\\n\\nThe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\\nkind of system.  If you don\\'t see what you want for your machine, check out\\nthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this\\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\\nInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\\n\\nX Windows:\\n\\nXV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other\\nimage formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image\\nmanipulations.  It\\'s available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),\\nfile contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support\\nfor 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new\\nand still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding\\nedge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that\\nversion 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you\\'ll get\\nonly 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works\\nfine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a\\nglitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the \"save at normal size\" checkbox\\nwhen saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.\\n\\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy\\'s free ImageMagick package,\\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\\nbasic free JPEG software.\\n\\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\\nfile contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\\n\\n\\nMS-DOS:\\n\\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.\\n\\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel\\'s free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\\nThe current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic\\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is\\nnot flashy, but it\\'s functional.\\n\\nAnother freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei\\'s Hiview.  The\\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\\nbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\\nOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\\non the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).\\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there\\'s no denying that it\\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\\n\\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.\\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don\\'t have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\\nVESA driver, so don\\'t try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\\nthat the driver is missing.)\\n\\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\\nthe net for a while, but I don\\'t know any stable archive location for it.\\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\\n\\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW\\'s JPEG implementation isn\\'t very good:\\nit\\'s slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it\\'d have been nice to see a\\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.\\n\\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can\\'t get *any*\\nof them to work, you\\'ll need to use one of the following conversion programs\\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\\nhave hi-color hardware, don\\'t use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\\nthing with hi-color displays.)\\n\\nThe Independent JPEG Group\\'s free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or\\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\\n\\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.\\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\\nparticular, you can\\'t get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI\\'s proprietary\\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.\\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\\n\\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.\\n\\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet\\'s key archive site for PC-related programs\\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\\nrefers to directory (eg) \"msdos/graphics\" at Simtel20, that really means\\n\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\\nin (eg) \"/pub/msdos/graphics\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\\n\\nMicrosoft Windows:\\n\\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\\ndue to Windows\\' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\\n\\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.\\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\\nBut it\\'s so fast you\\'ll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\\n\\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can\\'t create new JPEG\\nfiles, and it doesn\\'t view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it\\'s\\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.\\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\\n\\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\\n286-compatible version; if you register, you\\'ll get the 386-only version,\\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\\n\\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the\\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\\npub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will\\nbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)\\n\\nDVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen\\nmode, not in a window.\\n\\nOS/2:\\n\\nThe following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).\\nNote: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator\\nis not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip\\n    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.\\n/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip\\n    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip\\n    Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.\\n    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip\\n    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows\\n    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip\\n    PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP/Targa/PCX viewer.  GIF viewing very fast,\\n    JPEG viewing roughly the same speed as the above two programs.  Has\\n    image manipulation & slideshow functions.  Shareware, $20.\\n\\nMacintosh:\\n\\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple\\'s JPEG implementation, which is part of\\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you\\'re running System 6, you must also install\\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.\\n(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\\n\\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime\\'s JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is\\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\\n\\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it\\'s\\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\\nlike this behavior, some don\\'t.  Overall, JPEGView\\'s user interface is very\\nwell thought out.\\n\\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and\\nPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but\\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it\\'s faster with QuickTime.)\\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\\n\\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\\n\\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\\n\\nApple\\'s free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.\\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer\\'s tool, and it\\'s\\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\\nit, as it\\'s even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\\n\\nStorm Technology\\'s Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.\\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can\\'t\\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\\ndownloaded image file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\\n\\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\\ndon\\'t want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\\n\\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\\nJPEG file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\\n\\nAmiga:\\n\\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).

In the USA, a good\\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)\\n\\nHamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a\\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  It\\'s cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\\n\\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\\nsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is\\nsupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\\nAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\\n\\nViewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,\\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.\\n\\nIf you\\'re willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\\nsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another\\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file\\nAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\\n\\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \"AugJPEG\", \"NewAmyJPEG\",\\n\"VJPEG\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\\nit\\'s stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\\n\\nAtari ST:\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.\\nThese programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\\n\\nFor monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level\\ngrayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.\\n\\nI have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for\\nAtaris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.\\n\\nAcorn Archimedes:\\n\\n!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view\\nJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,\\nalthough this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.\\n\\nRecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle\\nJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be\\nfound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by\\nregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,\\nThe Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).\\n\\nThere\\'s also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write\\nfunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image\\nformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not\\nnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,\\nCambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.\\n\\nNeXT:\\n\\nImageViewer is a PD utility that displays images and can do some format\\nconversions.  The current version reads JPEG but does not write it.\\nImageViewer is available from the standard NeXT archives at\\nsonata.cc.purdue.edu and cs.orst.edu, somewhere in /pub/next (both are\\ncurrently being re-organized, so it\\'s hard to point to specific\\nsub-directories).  Note that there is an older version floating around that\\ndoes not support JPEG.\\n\\n\\nPortable software for almost any system:\\n\\nIf none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free\\nJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You\\'ll also need a viewer program.\\nIf your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a\\ndisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa\\nor PPM 24-bit image files.\\n\\nThere are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every\\nday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find\\nthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,\\npurchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether\\nthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can\\nhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are\\nnot and never will be compatible with anyone else\\'s files.\\n\\n\\n[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:\\n\\nFree, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent\\nJPEG Group, which I lead.

To display a full-color image, the\\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\\ncolors.  This process is called \"color quantization\".  (This is something\\nof a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We\\'re stuck with\\nthe standard usage though.)\\n\\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\\n\\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\\nThis happens because JPEG\\'s lossiness affects each pixel a little\\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \"smeared\"\\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\\n\\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it\\'s nearly meaningless to talk about\\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\\nposted images described as \"256-color JPEG\".  This tells me that the poster\\n(a) hasn\\'t read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\\nnumber of colors just isn\\'t a useful concept for JPEG.)\\n\\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\\npalette, and the format doesn\\'t allow more than 256 palette entries.)\\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don\\'t have to.\\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you\\'re stuck with the sender\\'s\\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\\nFurthermore, if the sender didn\\'t use a high-quality color quantization\\nalgorithm, you\\'re out of luck.\\n\\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\\nfor all users whose machines don\\'t match the sender\\'s display hardware.\\nJPEG\\'s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user\\'s display\\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you\\'re stuck forevermore with what was\\nsent.\\n\\nIt\\'s also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it\\'s\\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\\n\\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\\nin a machine-independent fashion.\\n\\n\\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\\n\\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\\ncoding.  This article\\'s long enough already, so I\\'m not going to say more\\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in\\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\\n\\n\\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\\n\\nThere\\'s a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\\n\\nSaying \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\\n\\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\\nvalue; it\\'s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\\n\\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\\n\\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\\n\\n\\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\\n\\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\\nstandards organizations.\\n\\nSince we can\\'t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\\n\"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren\\'t compatible with\\nanybody else\\'s.\\n\\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\\nthat\\'s been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transports\\n    pixels and not much else.\\n  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\\n    a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you\\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It\\'s not likely that adding JPEG to the\\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\\nof JPEG-related products; it\\'s reasonably likely that future commercial\\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\\n\\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well\\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common\\ndenominator\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\\n\\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple\\'s QuickTime\\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\\n\\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software\\'s programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and\\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\\n\\n\\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\\n\\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won\\'t read, it\\'s likely\\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\\n\\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by \\'JFIF\\'.\\n\\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\\n    \"raw JPEG\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\\n    it\\'s worth a try, anyway.\\n\\n3.  HSI files start with \\'hsi1\\'.  You\\'re out of luck unless you have HSI\\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\\n    won\\'t decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\\n\\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for \\'JFIF\\').  Strip off\\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\\n\\n5.  Anything else: it\\'s a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\\n    try stripping off everything before that.\\n\\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM_]C_X ...\\n\\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM:\\'-I ...\\n\\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\\n\\n\\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\\n\\nThe JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output\\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\\n\\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\\nfrom these companies.  (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement\\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\\nat best.)\\n\\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn\\'t great enough to justify the\\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\\n\\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\\n\\n\\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?\\n\\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\\nfirst time around.\\n\\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\\nfree JPEG software.  It\\'s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\\n\\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\\n(If you\\'re wondering why, it\\'s because the pixel-block boundaries move.\\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\\nthat\\'s a mighty limited capability!)\\n\\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\\ntransmission of images, but you don\\'t want to use it as an intermediate\\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\\nof compression/decompression time this way :-).\\n\\n\\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\\n\\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it\\'s far better to make a JPEG from\\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\\nloss of quality.\\n\\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\\ndon\\'t convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\\n\\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\\nDon\\'t waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don\\'t\\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,\\nnot 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\\n\\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself\\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\\nsystem, XV\\'s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\\nway to do this.)\\n\\ncjpeg\\'s default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\\n\\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\\ncolor noise; and JPEG can\\'t compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\\nTo get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression.\\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\\nthan you\\'d get without smoothing.\\n\\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\\ncapability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs.\\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\\nthe output image, which you don\\'t want.  If you are an image processing\\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg\\'s built-in smoother is\\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\\n\\nThe upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a\\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\\nimage, you\\'ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\\n\\n\\n---------------------\\n\\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\\n\\n-- \\n\\t\\t\\ttom lane\\n\\t\\t\\torganizer, Independent JPEG Group\\nInternet: tgl@cs.cmu.edu\\tBITNET: tgl%cs.cmu.edu@carnegie\\n' => comp.graphics \n",

What is XFree86?\\n\\n   XFree86 is an enhanced version of X386 1.2, which was distributed with\\n   X11R5.  This release consists of many bug fixes, speed improvements, and\\n   other enhancements.  Here are the highlights of the enhancements:\\n\\n    1) The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree86,\\n       selectable at run-time via the Xconfig file.  Some SpeedUps require\\n       an ET4000 based SVGA, and others require a virtual screen width of\\n       1024.  The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by\\n       default.  With a high-quality ET4000 board (VRAM), this can yield\\n       up to 40% improvement of the xStones benchmark over X386 1.2.\\n    2) The fX386 packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default\\n       operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected.  This mode is now\\n       equivalent in performance to X386 1.1b (X11R4), and approximately\\n       20% faster than X386 1.2.\\n    3) Support for LOCALCONN, compile-time selectable for server, clients,\\n       or both.  This support is for both SVR3.2 and SVR4.  For SVR4.0.4\\n       with the \\'Advanced Compatibility Package\\', local connections from\\n       SCO XSight/ODT clients are supported.\\n    4) Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGA8900C and TVGA9000 SVGA chipsets.\\n       Refer to the files README.ati and README.trident for details about\\n       the ATI and Trident drivers.\\n    5) Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added (Thomas Eberhardt\\'s\\n       code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu).\\n    6) Type1 Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included, and is\\n       compile-time selectable.  There are contributed Type1 fonts in the\\n       contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu.\\n    7) New configuration method which allows the server\\'s drivers and font\\n       renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary\\n       distributions.\\n    8) Integrated support for 386BSD, Mach, and Linux.\\n    9) A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA\\n       cards is now included.\\n\\n   The following key features were added with the release of XFree86 1.2\\n   (they were not in XFree86 1.1):\\n\\n    1) The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of\\n       available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200 \\n       (see the X386(1) manual page for more information).\\n    2) Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the\\n       monochrome server, and with it the ability to support a \"two\\n       headed\" server - one VGA, and one Hercules.  So far this has only\\n       been tested on SVR4 (it is also reported to work under Linux).\\n    3) SVR3 shared libraries, tested under ISC SVR3 2.2 and 3.0.1.\\n    4) Support for SVR4.2 (There are some special considerations to\\n       consider, due to new USL bugs; see the README.SVR4 file for\\n       more information.)\\n    5) Support for PS/2 mice, and Logitech MouseMan/TrackMan (some \\n       versions of these devices were not previously compatible).\\n    6) A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor\\n       timing data, written by Eric Raymond (derived from previous\\n       documentation and a lot of experimentation).\\n    7) Greatly improved support for international keyboards, including\\n       implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many \\n       vendor servers (see the X386keybd(1) manual page for more \\n       information).\\n    8) The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has\\n       been improved, and the timings are now stored at accuracies of\\n       0.1 MHz.  Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks\\n       line from their Xconfig file and re-probing using the new server.\\n    9) Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig\\n       configuration file.  Error messages are much more informative\\n       and intuitive, and more validation is done.  There are many new\\n       options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file (see the X386(1) \\n       manual page for more information on the format of this file).\\n\\n       Plus a number of other small things.  Refer to the CHANGELOG file\\n       in the source distribution for full details.\\n\\n   Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond, and the\\n   current X386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat.\\n\\n4. What OSs are supported?\\n\\n    XFree86 supports:\\n\\tSVR4.2: Consensys V4.2\\n\\tSVR4.0: Microport, Dell, Esix, ISC, AT&T, MST, Consensys, UHC\\n\\tSVR3: ISC 2.2 & 3.0, AT&T 2.2\\n\\tLinux, Mach 386, 386BSD 0.1\\n\\n\\tBSD/386 is not supported, but it should work. The most active\\n\\tBSD/386 person is Greg Lehey <grog@lemis.de>.\\n\\n\\tNote that Esix 3.2D and SCO are not supported yet,\\n\\tbut anyone should feel free to submit patches.\\n\\tIf you are interested in tackling this, send mail to\\n\\txfree86@physics.su.oz.au\\n\\n5. What video hardware is supported?\\n\\n   At this time, XFree86 1.2 supports the following SVGA chipsets:\\n\\n\\tTseng ET4000\\n\\tTseng ET3000\\n\\tParadise PVGA1\\n\\tWestern Digital WD90C00, WD90C10, WD90C11 (these are supersets of\\n\\t\\tthe PVGA1, and use its driver)\\n\\tGenoa GVGA\\n\\tTrident TVGA8900C, TVGA9000\\n\\tATI 18800, 28800\\n\\n\\tAll of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes,\\n\\twith the exception of the ATI chipsets, which are only supported in\\n\\t256 color mode.\\n\\n\\tThe monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k of\\n\\tvideo memory in a single bank, and the Hercules card.  On the\\n\\tET3000, only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome\\n\\tserver, and the GVGA has not been tested with more than 64k.\\n\\n\\tIt appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going to\\n\\tnon-traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock frequencies.  To\\n\\tavoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree86\\n\\t1.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel\\n\\tclock.  This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are\\n\\tdiscovered.  Refer to the README.clkprog file for information on how\\n\\tthese programs work, if you need to write one.  If you do develop such\\n\\ta program, the XFree86 team would be interested in including it with\\n\\tfuture XFree86 releases.\\n\\n\\tIf you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree86,\\n\\tit is suggested that you purchase an ET4000-based board such as the\\n\\tOrchid ProDesigner IIs.  Avoid recent Diamond boards; XFree86 will not\\n\\twork with them, because Diamond won\\'t provide programming details.\\n\\tIn fact, the XFree86 project is actively not supporting new Diamond\\n\\tproducts, as long as such policies remain in effect.  Contributions\\n\\tof code will NOT be accepted (because of the potential liabilities).\\n\\tIf you would like to see this change, tell Diamond about it.\\n\\n\\tSome people have asked if XFree86 would work with local bus or EISA\\n\\tvideo cards. Theoretically, the means of communication between the\\n\\tCPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree86 compatibility. It\\n\\tcould be ISA, EISA, or local bus.  What should matter is the chipset\\n\\ton the video card.  Unfortunately, the developers don\\'t have a lot\\n\\tof access to EISA or VLB machines, so this is largely an untested\\n\\ttheory.  However, we have yet to see any reports of things not\\n\\tworking on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree86\\n\\tworking fine on them.\\n\\n6. What about accelerated boards?\\n\\n\\tAt this time, there is no support in XFree86 for accelerated boards\\n\\tlike the S3, ATI Ultra (8514/A), TIGA, etc.  This support is available\\n\\tin commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink (for SVR3 and SVR4).\\n\\n\\tAn S3 server is available for 386BSD and Linux.  Contact\\n\\t<hasty@netcom.com> for 386BSD or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk> for Linux.\\n\\n\\tA beta 8514/A server is available for Linux. Contact <martin@cs.unc.edu>\\n\\tor <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk>. Note: these servers are NOT part of XFree86.\\n\\n7. Why doesn\\'t XFree86 support 16-color VGA modes?\\n\\n\\tThe reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the\\n\\t16-color modes.  In 256-color modes, each byte of frame buffer memory\\n\\tcontains 1 pixel.  But the 16-color modes are implemented as bit-\\n\\tplanes.  Each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from each\\n\\tof each of 8 pixels, and there are four such planes.  The MIT frame-\\n\\tbuffer code is not designed to deal with this.  If VGA handled\\n\\t16-color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte, the MIT code\\n\\tcould be modified to support this (or it already may; I\\'m not sure).\\n\\tBut for the VGA way of doing things, a complete new frame-buffer\\n\\timplementation is required.  Some beta testers are looking into this,\\n\\tbut nothing is yet available from the project.\\n\\n8. What other hardware or software requirements are there?\\n\\n\\tObviously, a supported SVGA board and OS are required.  To run\\n\\tX efficiently, 12-16MB of memory should be considered a minimum.\\n\\tThe various binary releases take 10-40MB of disk space, depending\\n\\ton the OS (e.g. whether or not it supports shared libraries).\\n\\tTo build from sources, at least 80MB of free disk space will\\n\\tbe required, although 120MB should be considered a comfortable \\n\\tlower bound.\\n\\n9. Where can I get source for XFree86?\\n\\n\\tSource patches for the current version (1.2, based on X11R5 PL22\\n\\tfrom MIT), are available via anonymous FTP from:\\n\\t\\texport.lcs.mit.edu (under /contrib/XFree86)\\n\\t\\tftp.physics.su.oz.au (under /XFree86)\\n\\t\\tftp.win.tue.nl (under /pub/XFree86)\\n\\t(For the rest of this FAQ, these 3 location will be called $FTP)\\n\\n\\tRefer to the README file under the specified directory for information\\n\\ton which files you need to get to build your distribution.\\n\\n10. Where can I get binaries for XFree86?\\n\\n\\tBinaries are available via anonymous FTP from:\\n\\t\\tftp.physics.su.oz.au\\t\\t- SVR4 binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /XFree86/SVR4\\n\\t\\tftp.win.tue.nl\\t\\t\\t- SVR4 binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /pub/XFree86/SVR4\\n\\t\\tferkel.ucsb.edu\\t\\t\\t- SVR4 binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /pub/SVR4/XFree86\\n\\t\\tstasi.bradley.edu\\t\\t- SVR4 binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /pub/XFree86/SVR4\\n\\t\\tblancmange.ma.utexas.edu\\t- SVR3 (ISC) binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /pub/ISC\\n\\t\\tftp.prz.tu-berlin.de            - SVR3 (ISC) binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /pub/pc/isc/XFree86\\n\\t\\ttsx-11.mit.edu\\t\\t\\t- Linux binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /pub/linux/packages/X11\\n\\t\\tagate.berkeley.edu\\t\\t- 386BSD binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86\\n\\t\\tftp.cs.uwm.edu\\t\\t\\t- Mach binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /i386\\n\\n\\tEnsure that you are getting XFree86 1.2 - some of these sites may\\n\\tarchive older releases as well.  Each binary distribution will\\n\\tcontain a README file that describes what files you need to take\\n\\tfrom the archive, and which compile-time option selections were\\n\\tmade when building the distribution.\\n\\nIV) What general things should I know about running XFree86?\\n\\n11. Installation directories\\n\\n\\tThe top-level installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot\\n\\t(/usr/X386, by default) variable in config/site.def. Binaries, include\\n\\tfiles, and libraries are installed in $ProjectRoot/{bin,include,lib}.\\n\\n\\tThis can be changed when rebuilding from sources, and can be modified\\n\\tvia symbolic links for those OSs that support them. This directory is\\n\\tnonstandard, and was chosen this way to allow XFree86 to be installed\\n\\talongside a commercial/vendor-supplied X implementation.\\n\\n12. Configuration files\\n\\n\\tThe XFree86 server reads a configuration file (\"Xconfig\") on startup.\\n\\tThe search path, contents and syntax for this file are documented in\\n\\tthe server manpage, which should be consulted before asking questions.\\n\\n13. Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modes\\n\\n\\tDavid E Wexelblat (dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com) maintains a database of known\\n\\tclock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings.\\n\\tThe database is installed in /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/modeDB.txt, and\\n\\tis in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc. This database is\\n\\talso available from him (for the latest copy), and is kept on\\n\\texport.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/X386.modeDB.Z, which is updated\\n\\toccasionally.  Obtain a copy of this database.  It just might have the\\n\\tsettings you need.  If you create new settings, please send them to\\n\\tDavid for inclusion in the database.\\n\\n\\tIf this doesn\\'t help you, the VideoModes.doc (by Eric Raymond) file \\n\\twith XFree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings.\\n\\tIt may be helpful to start with settings that almost work, and use\\n\\tthis description to get them right.  When you do, send the information\\n\\tto David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database.\\n\\n\\tNOTE: The old \\'clock.exe\\' program is not supported any more, and\\n\\t      is completely unnecessary.  If you need to determine dot\\n\\t      clock values for a new board, remove the \\'Clocks\\' line from\\n\\t      your Xconfig file (if present), and start the server.  The\\n\\t      server will probe for clocks itself and print them out.\\n\\t      You can use these values to put a \\'Clocks\\' line into your\\n\\t      Xconfig file, which is not necessary, but will speed up\\n\\t      starting the server in the future.\\n\\n14. Rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kit\\n\\n\\tIf you have installed the server Binary Link Kit, it is possible to\\n\\treconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server.  This is\\n\\tfully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit.\\n\\nV) What OS-specific things should I know about running XFree86?\\n\\n\\tFirst of all, the server must be installed suid-root (mode 4755).\\n\\n15. SVR4\\n\\tWhy won\\'t my xterm run properly?\\n\\n\\tIf your kernel is not built with the consem module, you should define\\n\\tCONSEM=no in you environment. Otherwise xterm won\\'t run.\\n\\tcsh users should use \\'setenv CONSEM no\\'\\n\\n\\tThe Esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymapping\\n\\tproblems with XFree86.  It recommended that this patch not be\\n\\tinstalled.  Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap.\\n\\n16. SVR3\\n\\n\\tMake sure you look at $FTP/README.ISC, if that\\'s what you are running.\\n\\n17. 386BSD\\n\\n\\tMake sure you look at $FTP/README.386BSD.\\n\\n\\tAlso, a separate 386BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey\\n\\t<Rich@Rice.edu>.  The latest version should be available in the\\n\\tfile XFree86-1.2-386BSD-FAQ at the following ftp sites:\\n\\n\\t    agate.berkeley.edu:/pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2\\n\\t    wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2\\n\\t    grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr:pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2\\n\\n18. Linux\\n\\n\\tYou must be running Linux 0.97pl4 or greater, and have the 4.1 gcc\\n\\tjump libraries installed.\\n\\n\\tMake sure the binaries X386, X386mono, xload and xterm are setuid root.\\n\\n\\tIf your kernel doesn\\'t have TCP support compiled in, you\\'ll have to\\n\\trun the server as \"X -pn\". The default startup configuration assumes\\n\\tthat TCP is not available. If it is, change the two files\\n\\t/usr/X386/bin/startx and /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers, removing the\\n\\t-pn argument to X386.\\n\\n\\tMake sure /dev/console is either a link to /dev/tty0 or has the major\\n\\tnumber 4, minor number 0. Also note that if /dev/console is not\\n\\towned by the user running X, then xconsole and xterm will not permit\\n\\tconsole output redirection. Xdm will properly change the owner, but\\n\\tstartx won\\'t.\\n\\n\\tWhen running xdm from rc.local, you will need to provide it with\\n\\ta tty, for example \"xdm < /dev/console &\".\\n\\n\\tFor more detailed information, please read the file README present\\n\\twith the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu.\\n\\n19. Mach\\n\\n\\tMake sure you look at $FTP/README.Mach.\\n\\nVI) What things should I know for building XFree86 from source?\\n\\n\\tThis section has been removed from the FAQ, since it is\\n\\tfully explained in $FTP/README and the OS-specific READMEs.\\n\\tPlease look at those files for information on building XFree86.\\n\\nVII) Is there anything special about building clients with XFree86?\\n\\n20. BSD compatibility library\\n\\n\\tA lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy(), etc.\\n\\tThe default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsd.a\\n\\twhich contains emulation for bcopy(), bzero(), bcmp(), ffs(), random(),\\n\\tseed(). A better way of providing the \\'b\\' functions is to include\\n\\t<X11/Xfuncs.h> in source files that call them.  Xfuncs.h provides macro\\n\\tdefinitions for these in terms of the SYSV \\'mem\\' functions.  If you are\\n\\tlinking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these\\n\\tfunctions, then you should link with libXbsd.a\\n\\n21. ANSICCOPTIONS\\n\\n\\tThis is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the\\n\\tANSI-ness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewrite\\n\\tthe entire CCOPTIONS line.  For example, with stock MIT, you\\'d see\\n\\tsomething like\\n\\t\\tCCOPTIONS=\"-ansi -O2 -fwritable-strings\"\\n\\tand to get rid of the ANSI-ness, the developer would have to put\\n\\t\\tCCOPTIONS=\"-O2 -fwritable-strings\"\\n\\tin his Imakefile.  With this change, you would see a default of\\n\\t\\tANSICCOPTIONS=\"-ansi\"\\n\\t\\tCCOPTIONS=\"-O2 -fwritable-strings\"\\n\\tand all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile is:\\n\\t\\tANSICCOPTIONS=\\n\\tto get rid of the ANSI-ness (many X clients will die a horrible death\\n\\twith -ansi).  The effect is even more dramatic in practice, because\\n\\tCCOPTIONS is actually quite complex.  The other issue is that one must\\n\\tadd \\'ANSICCOPTIONS=$(ANSICCOPTIONS)\\' to a PassCDebugFlags definition.\\n\\nXFree86 Contact Information\\n\\n    Ongoing development planning and support is coordinated by the XFree86\\n    Core Team.

We\\nalso get to see Don Cherry\\'s Grapevine just before the game. The\\nGrapevine is a hockey talk show where Don talks to a player or coach\\nabout what else: Hockey.  It\\'s actually a pretty good show and Don\\nisn\\'t as annoying as he is on Coaches Corner.  I think this is were\\nDon got his nickname \\'Grapes\\' but I\\'m not sure.  Don use to coach the\\nBoston Bruins.  I don\\'t know exactly when that was.  Could someone fill\\nme in on this info?\\n  A local radio station here in Detroit (WLLZ) talks to Don every Tuesday\\nmorning.  Personally, I\\'ve had my fill of Donny!  He really pisses me off\\nsometimes.  During the Detroit-Toronto game Monday night on CBC, Don gave\\nhigh praise to Doug Gilmour, saying he was a two-way player and not\\njust a designated goal scorer and that he is probably the best player\\nin the game because of that.  That\\'s fine and I agree that Gilmour\\nis a good two-way player BUT he said the EXACT same thing about Yzerman\\nabout a month ago on a local radio talk show.  What gives?\\n  It seems like he just has a set speech that he changes when he goes from\\ncity to city.\\n  Don Cherry:  \\'I think <insert star player name for city that he is in>\\n              is the best two-way player in the league today.\\'\\n \\n  There have been other times (can\\'t remember exactly what he said) that he\\nbasically changed his opinions to match the audience he was talking to.\\n  Someone here on the net said something about how Don criticized Mario\\nLemieux but when the time comes for Don to broadcast the Cup playoffs\\nfrom the Civic Center (Yes, I think the Pens will make it out of the\\nWales Conference) Don will apologize left and right for his remarks about\\nLemieux.  In my opinion, he is an ass.  And I won\\'t change my opinion\\nif I\\'m in a different city.\\n  Sorry, if this didn\\'t answer your question better but I just had to get\\nthis off my chest.\\n \\nLaurie Marshall\\nWayne State University\\nDetroit, Michigan\\nGo Wings!!!\\n' => rec.sport.hockey \n",

      "'From: daveb@pogo.wv.tek.com (Dave Butler)\\nSubject: Objectivity (was: After 2000 years...)\\nOrganization: Tektronix, Inc., Wilsonville,  OR.\\nLines: 83\\n\\nThis discussion on \"objective\" seems to be falling into solipsism (Eg: the\\nrecent challenge from Frank Dwyer, for someone to prove that he can actually\\nobserve phenomena).  Someones even made the statement that science is\\n\"subjective\" and that even atom are \"subjective.\" This is getting a bit silly\\nand the word \"objective\" is losing all meaning.  Lets start by remembering the\\ndefinition of \"objective\" which has been already presented:\\n\\n  objective ADJ. 1. Of or having to do with a material object as \\n    distinguished from a mental concept. 2. Having actual existence.\\n    3.a. Unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice. b. Based on\\n    observable phenomenon.\\n\\nThe Objectivity of a thing is not based on whether everyone agrees on that\\nthing (eg: the world is objectively round, regardless of the fact that there\\nexist flat earthers), but rather whether it is based observable and verifiable\\nphenomenon (instead of being based solely on peoples wishes, feeling, mental\\nprocesses, etc).  Thus atoms, being based on very observable and repeatable\\nphenomenon, are indeed considered to be objective rather than subjective. \\nEven weird, high energy physics is based on observable phenomenon (even though\\nthat observation can change the outcome).  Nor are those observable phenomenon\\naffected by emotion, or personal prejudice (eg: chemical reactions do not\\nchange to the whims of different people).  Thus to say that science is not\\nobjective (ie: objectively verifiable) is a bit silly, as that is the\\npoint of science.  Now I will agree that science is not objectively \"good;\" I\\nwill not thereby conclude though that science is not objective. \\n\\nNow some examples things which are \"objective\":  A D-12 tractor is larger\\nthan the average breadbox.  Chlorophyll is green.  Seawater contains salt.\\nThere exists ozone in the atmosphere (at least presently).  Ozone blocks \\nultraviolet light.  Ultraviolet light increases the incidents of skin Cancer.\\n\\n\"Good\" on the other hand is a value judgement.  It doesn\\'t seem to have an\\nexistence apart from what we give it (unless someone can objectively show the\\nexistence of an omnipotent entity which has defined \"good\").  We cannot\\nquantify it, touch it or collect it in any concrete sense (eg: I have a bag\\nfull of \"good\").  Now we do sometimes attempt to give the word \"good\" an\\nobjective meaning, e.g.  \"good\" has been used to denote strength, resiliency,\\nspeed, etc.  That though, is a subjective definition, as some might not see\\n\"strength\" and etc, as necessarily \"good\" (eg: strength inspired by Naziism \\nis not generally viewed as \"good\"). \\n\\nAs to a morality, I cannot say that I have ever seen a morality strictly based\\non verifiable observable phenomenon.  The closest I have seen is some form of\\nthe \"Golden Rule,\" which concludes that it is best not to deliberately piss\\npeople off, as they will likely then involve themselves in your life, in a\\nmanner you won\\'t like.  This is verifiable; when you \"get in someone\\'s face,\"\\nthey will often retaliate.  Another objective fact about morality is that a\\nmore powerful group can enforce their morality on a weaker group, and thus can\\nat times, ignore that form of the \"Golden Rule\" without fear of reprisal.  Now\\nas to whether this enforcing of morality is \"good\" or \"bad,\" is quite\\nsubjective.  By the way, remember that subjective does not mean that a thing\\ncannot be formally stated, or even commonly agreed upon; it only means that\\nthat it is not verifiable from observable phenomena, or has a physical\\nexistence unto itself.  Also note that I have not stated that there is no such\\nthing as an objective morality, or that I could not accept any such a\\nmorality; I have simply stated that I have seen no evidence of any such\\nmorality. \\n\\nOne other thing to notice, \"objective\" is many times used as synonymous with\\n\"true\" and/or \"absolute,\" and \"subjective\" sometimes has the connotation of\\n\"false\" and/or \"relative.\" Tain\\'t necessarily so.  For instance, when a\\nconclusion is based on objective, but insufficient evidence, then it can be\\nboth objective and false.  As to \"absolute,\" it is easy to note that while we\\ncan objectively show that TNT is explosive, but that does not absolutely mean\\nthat all TNT will explode, and thus objective is not necessarily absolute\\neither.  On the other hand, something subjective can also be either\\n\"absolutist,\" or \"true.\" For instance, there are some theists who are\\nspecifically \"absolutist\" in their morality, even though they have only\\nsubjective evidence to back it up.  Further, many a scientist and detective\\nhas been motivated by subjective reasons (eg: a \"gut feeling\" or \"hunch\"), to\\ninvestigate a phenomena or situation, and gather the objective evidence\\nnecessary to support a true hypothesis.  On the whole though, I would have to\\nagree that objective evidence is much more trustworthy than subjective\\nevidence.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLater,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDave Butler\\n\\n    In starting any thesis, it seems to me, one should put forward as one\\'s\\n    point of departure something incontrovertible; the expression should be\\n    simple and dignified.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDiogenes\\n' => talk.religion.misc \n",

It is indeed possible to have two cards *configured* to use\\nthe same interrupt.  They can not *share* the interrupt in the sense that it\\nis not possible to have both cards active at the same time.\\n\\nHere is an example.  For some time, I was short of \"free interrupts.\"  I had a\\ntape controller (not a \"floppy tape\") that needed one of IRQ0-IRQ7.  (It\\'s an\\n*old* tape drive.)  My solution was to use IRQ3 (also used for COM2, where my\\nmodem is).  I did this because I reasoned I would never be using the modem and\\nthe tape simultaneously.  When kermit runs, it installs its own interrupt\\nhandler for IRQ3 and uses the serial port.  If the tape drive were to generate\\nan interrupt, kermit would not have a clue what to do with/for the tape\\ncontroller.  (And since the tape controller would not be serviced, it would\\nmost likely \"hang.\")  Likewise, when the tape backup software runs, it\\ninstalls an interrupt handler for IRQ3.

The second part is \\n  posted to comp.sys.mac.system and features many questions about\\n  system  software.  The third part is posted every two weeks in\\n  comp.sys.mac.misc.  Tables of contents for those two pieces are\\n  included above. Please familiarize  yourself with all three\\n  sections of this document  before posting. \\n  \\n         All pieces  are available for anonymous ftp from\\n  rtfm.mit.edu (18.172.1.27) in the directory \\n  pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh.  Except for this introductory\\n  FAQ which appears in multiple newsgroups and is stored as\\n  general-faq.Z, the name of each file has the format of the last\\n  part of the group name followed by \"-faq.Z\", e.g the FAQ for\\n  comp.sys.mac.system is stored as system-faq.Z and the FAQ for\\n  comp.sys.mac.misc is stored as misc-faq.Z.  RTFM stores files as \\n  compressed (.Z) BINARY files.  If you leave off the .Z at the end\\n  of  the file name when \"getting\" the file, rtfm will automatically \\n  decompress the file before sending it to you.  You can also have \\n  these files mailed to you by sending an E-mail message to \\n  mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with the line:  send\\n  pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh/\"name\"  in the body text where\\n  \"name\" is the name of the file you want as  specified above (e.g.\\n  general-faq).  You can also send this server a message with the\\n  subject \"help\" for more detailed instructions.   \\n\\n    \\n\\n ==================== \\n I HAVE A QUESTION...  (1.0)\\n ====================\\n  \\n       Congratulations!  You\\'ve come to the right place.  Usenet is \\n  a wonderful resource for information ranging from basic questions\\n  (How do I lock a floppy disk?) to queries that would make Steve\\n  Jobs himself run screaming from the room in terror.  (I used\\n  ResEdit to remove resources Init #11, WDEF 34, and nVIR 17 from my\\n  system file and used the Hex Editor to add code string #A67B45 as a\\n  patch to the SFGetFile routine so the Standard File Dialog Box\\n  would be a nice shade of mauve.  Everything worked fine until I\\n  installed SuperCDevBlaster, and now when I use the Aldus driver to\\n  print from PageMaker 5.0d4 to a Linotronic 6000 my system hangs. \\n  P.S.  I\\'m running System 6.0.2 on a PowerBook 170.) \\n  \\n       Since the Macintosh newsgroups are medium to high volume, we\\n  ask that you first peruse this FAQ list including at least the\\n  table of contents for the other pieces of it, check any other\\n  relevant on-line resources listed below in question 1.2, especially\\n  the FAQ lists for the other Macintosh newsgroups, and RTFM (Read\\n  the Friendly Manual) before posting your question.  We realize that\\n  you are personally incensed that the System is taking up fourteen\\n  of your newly-installed twenty megs of RAM, but this question has\\n  already made its way around the world three hundred times before,\\n  and it\\'s developing tired feet.  Finally, before posting to any\\n  newsgroup (Macintosh or otherwise), please familiarize yourself\\n  with the basic etiquette of Usenet as described in the newsgroup\\n  news.announce.newusers.\\n\\n\\n HOW DO I USE THIS DOCUMENT?  WHERE CAN I GET IT?  (1.1) \\n     \\n         comp.sys.mac.faq is currently divided into multiple pieces,\\n  a general introduction which you\\'re reading now, and specific lists\\n  for the newsgroups comp.sys.mac.system and comp.sys.mac.misc.  FAQ\\n  lists for comp.sys.mac.wanted, comp.sys.mac.apps and\\n  comp.sys.mac.hardware are in development.  When ready each part\\n  will be available in its respective newsgroup.  All pieces are\\n  available via anonymous ftp from rtfm.mit.edu in the\\n  pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh directory. Except for this\\n  document itself which is named general-faq.Z the pieces are named\\n  as per the last part of the newsgroup they cover  followed by\\n  \"-faq\", e.g. system-faq.Z, misc-faq.Z.  The .Z means the  file is\\n  stored compressed so you\\'ll need to ftp it in binary mode and use\\n  either MacCompress, StuffIt Deluxe, or the UNIX uncompress command \\n  to decompress it.  However if you leave off the \".Z\" extension when\\n   you \"get\" the file, rtfm will automatically decompress the file\\n  before sending it to you. \\n  \\n         This introductory document is posted to all of the concerned\\n  newsgroups.  The tables of contents for each of the specific FAQ\\n  lists are at the beginning of this file so you should be able to\\n  get  at least some idea whether your question is answered anywhere\\n  else in the FAQ even if you don\\'t have the other parts at hand. \\n  It\\'s not always obvious, especially to newcomers, where a\\n  particular question or comment should be posted.  Please\\n  familiarize yourself with the FAQ lists in all the major Macintosh\\n  newsgroups before posting in any of them.  Which questions appear\\n  in which FAQs can serve as a basic guide to what posts belong\\n  where. \\n  \\n         To jump to a particular question search for\\n  section-number.question-number enclosed in parentheses.  For\\n  example to find \"Where can I FTP Macintosh software?\" search for\\n  the string  \"(2.1)\".  To jump to a section instead of a question\\n  use a zero for  the question number.\\n\\n\\n WHAT OTHER INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE?  (1.2)\\n\\n      comp.sys.mac.faq provides short answers to a number of \\n  frequently asked questions appropriate for the Usenet newsgroup\\n  comp.sys.mac.misc and comp.sys.mac.system.  Four other files are\\n  worthy of particular note: Daryl Spitzer maintains a FAQ list\\n  covering Macintosh programming for the newsgroup\\n  comp.sys.mac.programmer.  It\\'s posted to that group weekly and \\n  available for anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.uoregon (128.223.8.8) in \\n  /pub/mac.  Eric Rosen maintains a frequently asked questions list \\n  for comp.sys.mac.comm available in that newsgroup and from\\n  rascal.ics.utexas.edu in mac/faq (where the file you\\'re reading now\\n  is also irregularly archived).  This list answers many frequently\\n  asked questions about networking, UNIX and the Mac,\\n  telecommunications, and foreign file formats.  Norm Walsh has\\n  compiled an excellent FAQ for comp.fonts that answers a lot of\\n  questions about the various kinds of fonts and cross-platform\\n  conversion and printing.  It\\'s available in comp.fonts or by ftp\\n  from ibis.cs.umass.edu in /pub/norm/comp.fonts/FAQ*.  Finally Jim\\n  Jagielski maintains a FAQ for comp.unix.aux covering Apple\\'s UNIX\\n  environment, A/UX.  It\\'s posted every 2 to 3 weeks in comp.unix.aux\\n  and news.answers. It\\'s available for anonymous ftp at\\n  jagubox.gsfc.nasa.gov.\\n\\n\\n WHICH NEWSGROUP SHOULD I POST TO?  (1.3)\\n  \\n      There are no stupid questions, but there are misplaced ones. \\n  You wouldn\\'t ask your English teacher how to do the definite\\n  integral  of ln x between zero and one, would you?  So don\\'t ask\\n  the programmer newsgroup why your system is so slow when Microsoft\\n  Word is in the background.  Ignorance of basic netiquette is not an\\n  excuse. If you want people to help you, you need to learn their\\n  ways of  communicating.  \\n  \\n      Posting questions to the proper newsgroup will fill your\\n  mailbox with pearls of wisdom (and maybe a few rotten oysters too\\n  :-) ).  Posting to the wrong newsgroup often engenders a thundering\\n  silence.  For instance the most common and glaring mispost, one\\n  that seems as incongruous to dwellers in the Macintosh regions of\\n  Usenet as would a purple elephant to Aleuts in the Arctic, asking a\\n  question about networking anywhere except comp.sys.mac.comm,\\n  normally produces no useful responses.  Posting the same question\\n  to comp.sys.mac.comm ensures that your post is read and considered\\n  by dozens of experienced network administrators and not a few\\n  network software designers.\\n  \\n         Please post to exactly ONE newsgroup.  Do not cross-post. \\n  If a question isn\\'t important enough for you to take the extra\\n  minute to figure out where it properly belongs, it\\'s not important\\n  enough for several thousand people to spend their time reading. \\n  For the same reason comp.sys.mac.misc should not be used as a\\n  catch-all newsgroup.\\n  \\n         The breakdown of questions between different newsgroups in\\n  this document can also serve as a reasonable guide to what belongs\\n  where.  Specifically questions about productivity applications\\n  (software you bought your Macintosh to run, not software you bought\\n  to make your Macintosh run better) should go to comp.sys.mac.apps\\n  unless the application is covered in a more specific newsgroup. \\n  Communications programs, games, HyperCard, compilers and databases\\n  all have more topical comp.sys.mac.* newsgroups.  Post questions\\n  about non-communications hardware including questions about what\\n  software is necessary to make particular hardware work to\\n  comp.sys.mac.hardware.  Questions about MacOS system software\\n  belong in comp.sys.mac.system.  Questions about utilities and\\n  extensions normally belong in comp.sys.mac.misc.  Questions about\\n  A/UX go to comp.unix.aux.  Detailed questions about Appletalk\\n  belong in comp.protocols.appletalk.\\n  \\n         Direct questions about HyperCard to comp.sys.mac.hypercard. \\n  Non-HyperCard programming questions and questions about development\\n  environments should go to comp.sys.mac.programmer.  ResEdit\\n  questions may be posted either to comp.sys.mac.misc,\\n  comp.sys.mac.system, or comp.sys.mac.programmer; but generally the\\n  netters who inhabit the darker recesses of comp.sys.mac.programmer\\n  are considerably more practiced at the art of resource hacking. \\n  \\n         A general exception to the above rules is that any VERY\\n  technical question about an application that actually begins to\\n  delve into the how\\'s of a program as well as the what\\'s (Recent\\n  example: How does WriteNow which is written entirely in assembly\\n  compare to other word processors written in high level languages?)\\n  might be better addressed to the programmer newsgroup.\\n    \\n         For Sale and Want to Buy posts should go to\\n  comp.sys.mac.wanted and misc.forsale.computers.mac ONLY.  We\\n  understand that you\\'re desperate to sell your upgraded 128K Mac to\\n  get the $$ for a PowerBook 180; but trust me, anyone who wants to\\n  buy it will be reading comp.sys.mac.wanted.  Political and\\n  religious questions (The Mac is better than Windows! Is not! Is\\n  too! Is not! Is too! Hey! How \\'bout the Amiga! What about it? Is\\n  Not! Is too!) belong in comp.sys.mac.advocacy.  Anything not\\n  specifically mentioned above probably belongs in comp.sys.mac.misc.\\n  \\n         Finally don\\'t be so provincial as to consider only the\\n  comp.sys.mac newsgroups the appropriate forums for your questions. \\n  Many questions about modems in comp.sys.mac.comm are much more\\n  thoroughly discussed in comp.dcom.modems.  Questions about Mac MIDI\\n  are often better handled in comp.music even though it\\'s not a\\n  Macintosh specific newsgroup.  Shop around.  Usenet\\'s a big place\\n  and not everything relevant to the Macintosh happens in\\n  comp.sys.mac.\\n\\n\\n 4. SOMEONE JUST ASKED WHY THE SYSTEM WAS TAKING UP SIXTEEN OF\\n THEIR  TWENTY MEGABYTES OF RAM.  SHOULDN\\'T I PUT MY BRILLIANCE AND\\n WIT ON  DISPLAY FOR THE WORLD BY POSTING THE SEVENTEENTH RESPONSE?\\n\\n      No.  Frequent answers are just as boring and uninteresting as\\n  frequent questions.  Unless you really have something new to add to\\n  the traditional answers (such as the recent discovery that fonts in\\n  System 7.1 could eat memory) private E-mail is a much better medium\\n  for answering common questions like this one.\\n   \\n         You might want to add a mention of this FAQ in your E-mail\\n  response and a polite suggestion that your correspondent read it\\n  before posting future questions.  I do read all the newsgroups\\n  covered here and have written a small script in MicroPhone II that\\n  lets me send PWFAQ\\'s (people with frequently asked questions) the\\n  section of this document that answers their question with just the\\n  click of a button so please don\\'t feel obligated to respond to\\n  someone who cares so little about the answer to their question they\\n  can\\'t be troubled to read the FAQ list to get it.\\n\\n    \\n\\n === \\n FTP  (2.0) \\n ===\\n\\n WHERE CAN I FTP MAC SOFTWARE?  (2.1)\\n\\n      The three major North American Internet archives of shareware,\\n  freeware, and demo software are sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6),\\n  mac.archive.umich.edu (141.211.165.41), and wuarchive.wustl.edu\\n  (128.252.135.4) which mirrors the other two sites and several\\n  others. Wuarchive often holds on to files after other sites remove\\n  them for space concerns, and still has files that were deleted from\\n  the formerly important site, rascal.ics.utexas.edu.  Rascal was\\n  notable for storing its files in MacBinary format rather than the\\n  less efficient BinHex format common at the other archives.  Unless\\n  otherwise noted shareware and freeware mentioned in this document\\n  should be available at the above sites.\\n  \\n       To keep traffic on the Internet manageable, Scandinavians \\n  should try connecting to ftp.funet.fi (128.214.6.100), ftp.lth.se\\n  (130.235.20.3), or sics.se (192.16.123.90) instead.  Those in \\n  the U.K. should look first at src.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.2.1). \\n  Continental Europeans can try nic.switch.ch (130.59.1.40),  \\n  ezinfo.ethz.ch (129.132.2.72), and anl.anl.fr(192.54.179.1). \\n  Australian users should try to find what they want at archie.au\\n  (139.130.4.6) which mirrors info-mac and mac.archive.  Japanese\\n  users will find sumex mirrored at ftp.u-tokyo.ac.jp\\n  (130.69.254.254). \\n\\n         A fourth very important site is ftp.apple.com (130.43.2.3). \\n  This is Apple\\'s semi-official repository for system software,\\n  developer tools, source code, technical notes, and other things\\n  that come more or less straight from Apple\\'s mouth.  Some material\\n  at this site may not be distributed outside the U.S. or by other\\n  sites that don\\'t have an official license to distribute Apple\\n  system software.  Please read the various README documents\\n  available at ftp.apple.com for the detailed info if you\\'re\\n  connecting from outside the U.S. or if you wish to redistribute\\n  material you find here.\\n\\n\\n CAN I GET SHAREWARE BY E-MAIL?  (2.2)\\n\\n      The info-mac archives at sumex-aim are available by E-mail from\\n  LISTSERV@RICEVM1.bitnet (alternately listserv@ricevm1.rice.edu). \\n  The listserver responds to the commands $MACARCH HELP, $MACARCH\\n  INDEX, and $MACARCH GET filename.  Mac archive files are available\\n  from mac@mac.archive.umich.edu.  Send it a message containing the\\n  words \"help\" and \"index\" (no quotes) on the first two lines of your\\n  message for instructions on getting started and a list of the files\\n  you may request.  You can retrieve files from other sites by using\\n  the server at ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com.  For details send it a\\n  message with just the text \"help\" (no quotes).\\n\\n\\n WHERE CAN I FIND APPLICATION X?  (2.3)\\n\\n      If you can\\'t find what you\\'re looking for at one of the above\\n  sites, try telnetting to your nearest archie server or sending it\\n  an E-mail message addressed to archie with the subject \"help.\" \\n  Archie servers are located at archie.rutgers.edu (128.6.18.15,\\n  America), archie.mcgill.ca (132.206.2.3, the original archie server\\n  in Canada), archie.au (139.130.4.6, Australia), archie.funet.fi\\n  (128.214.6.100, Scandinavia), and archie.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.3.7,\\n  the U.K. and the continent).  These sites index the tens of\\n  thousands of files available for anonymous ftp.  Login as \"archie\"\\n  (no password is needed) and type \"prog filename\" to find what\\n  you\\'re looking for or type \"help\" for more detailed instructions. \\n  For instance you would type \"prog Disinfectant\" to search for a\\n  convenient ftp site for Disinfectant.  If the initial search fails\\n  to turn up the file you want, try variations on and substrings of\\n  the name.  For instance if you didn\\'t find Disinfectant with \"prog\\n  Disinfectant\", you might try \"prog disi\" instead.  Substring\\n  searches often hide the gold in a pile of dross.  To avoid many\\n  erroneous matches add a \".*\\\\.hqx\" to the end of the substring, e.g.\\n  \"prog disi.*\\\\.hqx\"  Most Mac software available on the net ends in\\n  .hqx but almost no UNIX or PC software does. \\n\\n         Please check the above archives and ARCHIE personally BEFORE\\n  asking where you can find a particular piece of shareware.  If you\\n  follow the above advice, you should almost never have to ask the\\n  net where to find a particular piece of software.\\n\\n\\n CAN SOMEONE MAIL ME APPLICATION X?  (2.4)\\n\\n      No.  Nor will anyone mail you a part of a file from\\n  comp.binaries.mac that was corrupt or missed at your site.  Please\\n  refer to the first questions in this section to find out about\\n  anonymous FTP, archie, and automatic E-mail servers.\\n\\n\\n WHAT IS .BIN? .HQX? .CPT? .ETC?  (2.5)\\n\\n      Most files available by FTP are modified twice to allow them to\\n  more easily pass through foreign computer systems.  First they\\'re\\n  compressed to make them faster to download, and then they\\'re\\n  translated to either a binhex (.hqx) or MacBinary (.bin) format\\n  that other computers can digest.  (The Macintosh uses a special\\n  two-fork filing system that chokes most other computers.)  BinHex\\n  files are 7-bit ASCII text files, while MacBinary files are pure\\n  8-bit binary data that must always be transferred using a binary\\n  protocol.\\n  \\n         How a file has been translated and compressed for\\n  transmission is indicated by its suffix.  Normally a file will have\\n  a name something like filename.xxx.yyy.  .xxx indicates how it was\\n  compressed and .yyy indicates how it was translated.  To use a file\\n  you\\'ve FTP\\'d and downloaded to your Mac you\\'ll need to reverse the\\n  process.  Most files you get from the net require a two-step\\n  decoding process.  First change the binhex (.hqx) or MacBinary\\n  (.bin) file to a double-clickable Macintosh file; then decompress\\n  it.  Which programs decode which file types is covered in the table\\n  below.  Also note that most Macintosh telecommunications programs\\n  will  automatically convert MacBinary files to regular Macintosh\\n  files as they are downloaded.\\n\\n***************************************************************************\\nSuffix:      .sit  .cpt  .hqx  .bin  .pit  .Z  .image  .dd  .zip .uu  .tar \\nExtractors\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nStuffIt 3.0|   X     X     X     X     X                  \\nCompact Pro|         X     X \\nPackit     |                           X\\nUUTool     |                                                      X \\nMacCompress|                                X \\nSunTar     |               X     X     X                                X \\nBinHex 5.0 |                     X \\nBinHex 4.0 |               X \\nDiskDoubler|                           X                X \\nUnZip      |                                                   X \\nDiskCopy   |                                     X \\nmacutil    |         X     X           X                X\\n***************************************************************************\\n\\n     A few notes on the decompressors:\\n\\n      StuffIt is a family of products that use several different\\n  compression schemes.  The freeware StuffIt Expander will unstuff\\n  all of them.  Versions of StuffIt earlier than 3.0 (StuffIt 1.5.1,\\n  StuffIt Classic, UnStuffIt, and StuffIt Deluxe 2.0 and 1.0) will\\n  not unstuff the increasing number of files stuffed by StuffIt 3.0. \\n  You need to get a more recent version of StuffIt or StuffIt\\n  Expander. \\n    \\n         StuffIt 3.0.5 (Lite and Deluxe) consistently makes smaller\\n  archives than any other Macintosh compression utility.  To allow\\n  maximum space for files on the various ftp sites and to keep\\n  net-bandwidth down, please compress all files you send to anonymous\\n  ftp sites with StuffIt 3.0.5.\\n   \\n         UUTool, MacCompress, and SunTar handle the popular UNIX\\n  formats of  uuencode (.uu), compress (.Z), and tar (.tar)\\n  respectively.  The UNIX versions are often more robust than the Mac\\n  products, so use them instead when that\\'s an  option.  Translators\\n  that allow StuffIt Lite to expand uuencoded and tar files are also\\n  available by anonymous ftp. \\n  \\n         Macutil is dik winter\\'s package of UNIX utilities to\\n  decompress and debinhex files on a workstation before downloading\\n  them to a Mac. Since UNIX stores files differently than does the\\n  Mac, macutil creates MacBinary (.bin) files which should be\\n  automatically converted on download.  It can\\'t decompress\\n  everything. In particular it can\\'t decompress the new StuffIt 3.0\\n  archives. :-(  However, if you need only one or two files out of an\\n  archive--for instance if you want to read the README to find out if\\n  a program does what you need it to do before you download all of\\n  it--macutil is indispensable.  It can be found at sumex-aim in the\\n  info-mac/unix directory.\\n\\n     A few notes on the compression formats:\\n\\n      .bin:  These are MacBinary files.  Always use a binary file\\n  transfer protocol when transferring them, never ASCII or text. \\n  Most files on the net are stored as .hqx instead.  Only rascal\\n  stores most of its files in .bin format.  Most communications\\n  programs such as ZTerm and MacKermit are capable of translating\\n  MacBinary files on the fly as they download if they know in advance\\n  they\\'ll be downloading MacBinary files.\\n  \\n      .image: This format is normally used only for system software,\\n  so that on-line users can download files that can easily be\\n  converted into exact copies of the installer floppies.  Instead of\\n  using DiskCopy to restore the images to floppies, you can use Steve\\n  Christensen\\'s freeware utility  MountImage to treat the images on\\n  your hard disk as actual floppies inserted in a floppy drive. \\n  MountImage has a reputation for being buggy, so you should have\\n  some blank floppies and a copy of DiskCopy handy just in case.\\n  \\n      .sea (.x, .X):  .sea files don\\'t merit a position in the above\\n  table because they\\'re self-extracting.  They may have been created\\n  with Compact Pro, StuffIt, or even DiskDoubler; but all should be\\n  capable of decompressing themselves when double-clicked.  For some\\n  unknown reason Alysis has chosen not to use this industry standard\\n  designation for self-extracting archives created with their \\n  payware products SuperDisk! and More Disk Space.  Instead they \\n  append either .x or .X to self-extracting archives.\\n\\n\\n HOW CAN I GET BINHEX?  STUFFIT?  ETC.?  (2.6)\\n\\n      By far the easiest way to get these programs is to ask a human\\n  being to copy them onto a floppy for you.  If you\\'re at a\\n  university there\\'s absolutely no excuse for not finding someone to\\n  give you a copy; and if you\\'re anywhere less remote than McMurdo\\n  Sound, chances are very good that someone at a computer center,\\n  dealership, or user group can provide you with a copy of StuffIt. \\n  Once you have StuffIt (any version) you don\\'t need BinHex.\\n    \\n         If you\\'re such a computer geek that the thought of actually\\n  asking a living, breathing human being instead of a computer \\n  terminal for something turns you into a quivering mass of \\n  protoplasmic jelly, you can probably download a working copy  of\\n  StuffIt from a local bulletin board system. \\n  \\n         If you have religious objections to software gotten by any \\n  means other than anonymous ftp, then I suppose I\\'ll mention that \\n  you can in fact ftp a working copy of StuffIt though this is by \\n  far the hardest way to get it.  Ftp to wuarchive.wustl.edu and \\n  login.  Type the word \"binary.\"  Hit return.  Type \"cd\\n  mirrors/rascal.ics.utexas.edu/compression\" and hit return.  Then\\n  \"get StuffIt_Expander_1.0.1_SEA_bin\"  and hit return.  Of course\\n  it\\'s always possible that by the time you read this StuffIt\\n  Expander will have been updated and the name changed so if this\\n  fails look for something similar.  If you\\'ve ftp\\'d straight onto\\n  your Mac you should now have a self-extracting archive which will\\n  produce a working copy of StuffIt Expander when double-clicked.  If\\n  you\\'ve ftp\\'d to your mainframe or UNIX account first, you still\\n  need to use a modem program to download it to your Mac.  Just make\\n  sure that the Mac is receiving in MacBinary mode and the mainframe\\n  is sending in binary mode.  If you need more details on the last\\n  step, consult the FAQ list for comp.sys.mac.comm and the manuals\\n  for both your mainframe and Macintosh telecommunications software.\\n  \\n  \\n  HOW CAN I GET BINHEX, STUFFIT, ETC. FROM A PC?  (2.7)\\n\\n       You can\\'t.  There is absolutely NO way to get an executable\\n  Macintosh file from an ftp site onto a PC and then onto your Mac\\n  without some software obtained by means other than anonymous ftp.\\n  You MUST beg, borrow, or steal the necessary software such as\\n  Binhex or StuffIt Lite from another person.  I realize this may \\n  terrify those among you who haven\\'t left your parents\\' basement \\n  since you got an  Apple II+ in 1980, but eventually you\\'re going \\n  to need to link up with some human being other than your mother.  \\n  (though I suppose if you\\'re this much of  a nerd you could send \\n  your mother out to get it for you.)  While you\\'re gathering\\n  your nerves for a venture into the strange and terrifying world \\n  of daylight, please don\\'t bother the net by asking this question\\n  again.  There simply is no way to move executable Macintosh\\n  programs from a PC or other non-Macintosh computer onto a \\n  Mac without software that is not bundled with most Macs.\\n\\n\\n\\n=================================================================\\nTROUBLESHOOTING: WHAT TO DO (BEFORE POSTING) WHEN THINGS GO WRONG (3.0)\\n================================================================= \\n\\n         While the various FAQ lists cover a lot of specific\\n  problems, there are far more problems that aren\\'t covered here. \\n  These are a few basic techniques you should follow before asking\\n  for help.  You should probably also perform the ten-step\\n  preventative maintenance routine described in section four,\\n  especially rebuilding the desktop (4.3) and resizing the system\\n  heap (4.5).  Following these steps may  or may not solve your\\n  problem, but it will at least make it easier  for others to\\n  recommend solutions to you.\\n\\n IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM.  (3.1)\\n\\n      \"Microsoft Word is crashing\" doesn\\'t say much.  What were you\\n  doing when it crashed?  Can you repeat the actions that lead to the\\n  crash?  The more information you provide about the actions\\n  preceding the crash the more likely it is someone can help you. \\n  The more precisely you\\'ve identified the problem and the actions\\n  preceding it (Step 1) the easier it will be to tell if the\\n  following steps fix the problem.  For example, \"Sometimes\\n  QuarkXPress 3.0 crashes with a coprocessor not installed error.\" is\\n  not nearly as helpful as \"QuarkXPress 3.0 crashes when I link two\\n  text boxes on a master page when copies of those text boxes already\\n  contain text.\"  The former will leave you wondering whether the bug\\n  remains after a given step.  The latter lets you go right to the\\n  problem and see if it\\'s still there or not.\\n\\n\\n READ THE READ ME FILE.  (3.2)\\n\\n      Many companies include a list of known incompatibilities and\\n  bugs in their READ ME files.  Often these aren\\'t documented in the\\n  manual. Read any READ ME files to see if any of the problems sound\\n  familiar.\\n\\n\\n CHECK FOR VIRUSES.  (3.3)\\n\\n      Run Disinfectant or another anti-viral across your disk.  Virus\\n  infections are rarer than most people think, but they do occur and\\n  they do cause all sorts of weird problems when they do.\\n\\n\\n REINSTALL THE APPLICATION AND ALL ITS SUPPORT FILES.  (3.4)  \\n   \\n       For half a dozen reasons (external magnetic fields,\\n  improperly written software, the alignment of the planets) a file\\n  on a disk may not contain the data it\\'s supposed to contain.  This\\n  can cause all types of unexplained, unusual behavior.  Restoring\\n  from original masters will normally fix this.\\n\\n\\n REINSTALL THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE.  (3.5)  \\n\\n      Bits are even more likely to get twiddled in the system file\\n  than in the application and the effects can be just as disastrous. \\n  See question 4.6 for a detailed procedure for performing a  clean\\n  reinstall. \\n  \\n         If the problem continues to occur after you\\'ve taken these\\n  steps, chances are you\\'ve found either a conflict between your\\n  application and some other software or a genuine bug in the\\n  program.  So it\\'s time to\\n\\n\\n ISOLATE THE PROBLEM.  (3.6)  \\n \\n         You need to find the minimal system on which the problem\\n  will assert itself.  Here are the basic steps of isolating the\\n  cause of a system or application crash:\\n  \\n     a.\\tRun only one application at a time. Occasionally applications do\\n     conflict with each other.  If the problem does not manifest itself\\n     without other applications running simultaneously, you can begin\\n     launching other applications until you find the one that causes \\n     the crash.\\n     \\n     b.\\tIf you\\'re running System 6, turn off MultiFinder.  If you\\'re\\n     running System 7, allot as much memory to the application as you \\n     can afford.  Sometimes programs just need more memory, especially \\n     when performing complicated operations.\\n     \\n     c. If you\\'re running System 7, turn off virtual memory and 32-bit\\n     addressing.  There\\'s still an awful lot of System 7 hostile\\n     software out there including some from companies that really \\n     have no excuse.  (Can you say Microsoft Word 5.1, boys and girls?  \\n     I knew you could.)  Some of this software only expresses its \\n     incompatibilities when certain uncommon actions are taken.\\n     \\n     d.\\tBoot from a virgin system floppy.  If the problem disappears\\n     you likely have an init conflict.  You need to progressively remove\\n     extensions until the problem vanishes.  Use a little common sense\\n     when choosing the first extensions to remove.  If the problem occurs\\n     when you try to open a file, remove any inits that mess with the\\n     Standard File Open procedure such as Super Boomerang first.  If the\\n     problem remains after the obvious candidates have been eliminated,\\n     either remove the remaining extensions one at a time or, if you have\\n     a lot of them, perform a binary search by removing half of the\\n     extensions at a time.  Once the problem disappears add half of the\\n     most recently removed set back.  Continue until you\\'ve narrowed the\\n     conflict down to one extension.  When you think you\\'ve found the\\n     offending init restart with only that init enabled just to make \\n     sure that it and it alone is indeed causing the problem.\\n\\n\\n CONTACT TECHNICAL SUPPORT.  (3.7)\\n\\n      By now you should have a very good idea of when, where, and why\\n  the conflict occurs.  If a tech support number is available for the\\n  software, call it.  If you\\'re lucky the company will have a work\\n  around or fix available.  If not, perhaps they\\'ll at least add the\\n  bug to their database of problems to be fixed in the next release.\\n\\n    \\n\\n ====================== \\n PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE  (4.0)\\n ======================\\n\\n      You wouldn\\'t drive your car 100,000 miles without giving it a\\n  tune-up.  A computer is no different.  Regular tune-ups avoid a lot\\n  of problems.  Although there are Mac mechanics who\\'ll be happy to\\n  charge you $75 or more for the equivalent of an oil change, there\\'s\\n  no reason you can\\'t change it yourself.  The following nine-step\\n  program should be performed about every three months. \\n\\n\\n TRASH UNNEEDED FILES  (4.1)\\n\\n      Many of the operations that follow will run faster and more\\n  smoothly the more free disk space there is to work with so spend a\\n  little time cleaning up your hard disk.  If you\\'re at all like me,\\n  you\\'ll find several megabytes worth of preferences files for\\n  applications you no longer have, archives of software you\\'ve\\n  dearchived, shareware you tried out and didn\\'t like, announcements\\n  for events that have come and gone and many other files you no\\n  longer need.  If you\\'re running System 7 you may also have several\\n  more megabytes in your trash can alone.  Throw them away and empty \\n  the trash.\\n\\n\\n RETHINK YOUR EXTENSIONS  (4.2)\\n\\n      Some Macintoshes attract inits like a new suit attracts rain. \\n  Seriously consider whether you actually need every extension \\n  in your collection.  If you don\\'t use the functionality of an\\n  extension at least every fifth time you boot up, you\\'re probably\\n  better off not storing it in your System Folder where it only takes\\n  up memory, destabilizes your system, and slows down every startup. \\n  For instance if you only read PC disks once a month, there\\'s no\\n  need to keep AccessPC loaded all the time.  Cutting back on your\\n  extension habit can really help avoid crashes. \\n\\n\\n REBUILD THE DESKTOP  (4.3)\\n\\n      The Desktop file/database holds all the information necessary\\n  to associate each file with the application that created it.  It\\n  lets the system know what application should be launched when you\\n  open a given file and what icons it should display where. \\n  Depending on its size each application has one or more\\n  representatives in the desktop file.  As applications and files\\n  move on and off your hard disk, the Desktop file can be become\\n  bloated and corrupt.  Think of it as a Congress for your Mac. \\n  Every so often it\\'s necessary to throw the bums out and start with\\n  a clean slate.  Fortunately it\\'s easier to rebuild the desktop than\\n  to defeat an incumbent. \\n  \\n         One warning: rebuilding the desktop will erase all comments\\n  you\\'ve stored in the Get Info boxes.  Under System 7 Maurice\\n  Volaski\\'s freeware init CommentKeeper will retain those comments\\n  across a rebuild.  CommentKeeper also works with System 6 but only \\n  if Apple\\'s Desktop Manager extension is also installed. \\n  \\n         To rebuild the desktop restart your Mac and, as your\\n  extensions finish loading, depress the Command and Option keys. \\n  You\\'ll be presented with a dialog box asking if you want to rebuild\\n  the desktop and warning you that \"This could take a few minutes.\" \\n  Click OK. It will take more than a few minutes. The more files you\\n  have the longer it will take.  If you\\'re running System 6 you may\\n  want to turn off MultiFinder before trying to rebuild the desktop.\\n   \\n          If you\\'re experiencing definite problems and not just doing\\n  preventive maintenance, you may want to use Fifth Generation\\'s\\n  freeware init Desktop Reset.  Desktop Reset completely deletes the\\n  Desktop file before rebuilding it, thus eliminating possibly\\n  corrupt data structures.    \\n\\n\\n ZAP THE PRAM AND RESET THE CLOCK  (4.4)\\n\\n      All Macs from the original 128K Thin Mac to the Quadra 950\\n  contain a small amount of battery powered RAM to hold certain\\n  settings that properly move with the CPU rather than with the disk\\n  such as which disk to boot from.  Unfortunately this \"parameter\\n  RAM\" can become corrupted and cause unexplained crashes.  To reset\\n  it under System 7 hold down the Command, Option, P, and R keys\\n  while restarting your Mac.  Under System 6 hold down the Command,\\n  Option, and Shift keys while selecting the Control Panel from the\\n  Apple menu. Click Yes when asked if you want to zap the parameter\\n  RAM.  Since you\\'ve erased almost all the settings in the General\\n  Control Panel, you should now reset them to whatever you want.\\n   \\n         The one setting that zapping the PRAM does not erase is the \\n  date and time; but since the internal clock in the Macintosh is\\n  notoriously inaccurate you\\'ll probably want to take this\\n  opportunity to reset it anyway.\\n\\n\\n RESIZE THE SYSTEM HEAP  (4.5) \\n\\n      Even after rethinking their extensions as per step two most\\n  people still have at least half a row of icons march across the\\n  bottom of their screen every time they restart.  All these\\n  extensions (and most applications too) need space in a section of\\n  memory called the System Heap.  If the System Heap isn\\'t big enough\\n  to comfortably accommodate all the programs that want a piece of\\n  it, they all start playing King of the Mountain on the system heap,\\n  knocking each other off to get bigger pieces for themselves and\\n  trying to climb back on after they get knocked off.  All this\\n  fighting amongst the programs severely degrades system performance\\n  and almost inevitably crashes the Mac.\\n  \\n         If you\\'re using System 7, your Macintosh will automatically\\n  resize the system heap as necessary; but if you\\'re running System 6\\n  it\\'s important to set your system heap size large enough to manage\\n  all your extensions and applications.  By default this size is set\\n  to 128K, way too small for most Macs with any extensions at all. \\n  The system heap size is stored in the normally non-editable boot\\n  blocks of every system disk.  Bill Steinberg\\'s freeware utility\\n  BootMan not only lets you resize your system heap but even checks\\n  how much memory your heap is already using so it can tell how much\\n  needs to be allocated.  If you\\'re running System 6, get BootMan,\\n  use it, and be amazed at how infrequently your Macintosh crashes.\\n\\n\\n REINSTALL THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE  (4.6)\\n\\n      System files can become corrupt and fragmented, especially if\\n  you\\'ve stored lots of fonts and desk accessories inside them. \\n  Merely updating the System software will often not fix system file\\n  corruption.  I recommend doing a clean reinstall.  Here\\'s how:\\n\\n    1.  Boot from the installer floppy of your System disks.  \\n    2.  Copy any non-standard fonts and desk accessories out \\n        of your System file into a temporary suitcase.\\n    3.  Trash the System file on your hard disk.  Also trash the \\n        Finder, MultiFinder, DA Handler, and all other standard Apple \\n        extensions like Control Panel and Chooser.  These will all be \\n        replaced in the new installation.  If you\\'re running or \\n        installing System 7, move everything in the Extensions, \\n        Control Panels, and Preferences folders into the top level \\n        of the System Folder.\\n    4.  Rename the System Folder.  Any name other than System Folder \\n        is  fine.\\n    5.  Double-click the installer script on your System disk.  Then \\n        choose Customize...  Select the appropriate software for your \\n        model Mac and printer.  You could do an Easy Install instead, \\n        but that will only add a lot of extensions and code you don\\'t \\n        need that waste your memory and disk space.\\n    6.  Once installation is finished, move everything from the \\n        temporary folder you created in step 4 into the new System \\n        folder.  If you\\'re asked if you want to replace anything, you \\n        forgot to take something out in step 3.  You\\'ll need to replace \\n        things individually until you find the duplicate piece. \\n    7.  Reinstall any fonts or DA\\'s you removed in step 2.\\n    8.  Reboot.  You should now have a clean, defragmented System file \\n        that takes up less memory and disk space and a much more stable \\n        system overall.\\n\\n\\n     DISK UTILITIES  (4.7)\\n\\n      Much like system files hard disks have data structures that\\n  occasionally become corrupted affecting performance and even\\n  causing data loss.  Apple includes Disk First Aid, a simple utility\\n  for detecting and repairing hard disk problems, with its System\\n  disks. It\\'s also available for anonymous ftp from ftp.apple.com in\\n  the  directory dts/mac/sys.soft/hdsc.  Even if you have an earlier \\n  version, you should get the latest version (7.1) from ftp.apple.com\\n  and run it on all your hard disks.\\n     \\n         Several companies have released payware disk utilities that\\n  detect and repair considerably more problems than Disk First Aid\\n  though, interestingly, none of them detect and repair everything\\n  that Disk First Aid does.  The three most effective for general\\n  work are Central Point\\'s MacTools Deluxe 2.0, Fifth Generation\\'s\\n  Public Utilites, and Symantec\\'s Norton Utilities for the Macintosh\\n  2.0.  A department or work group should have all of these as well\\n  as Disk First Aid since none of them fix everything the others do. \\n  For individuals MacTools ($48 street) is about half the price of\\n  Norton ($94 street) or Public Utilities ($98 street) so, features\\n  and ease of use being roughly equal, I recommend MacTools.\\n   \\n         All of these products occasionally encounter problems they\\n  can\\'t fix.  When that happens it\\'s time to backup (4.7) and\\n  reformat (4.9).\\n\\n\\n     BACKING UP  (4.8)\\n\\n      This is one part of preventative maintenance that should be\\n  done a LOT more often than every three months.  The simplest back\\n  up is to merely copy all the files on your hard disk onto floppies\\n  or other removable media.  If you keep your data files separate\\n  from your application and support files then it\\'s easy to only back\\n  up those folders which change frequently.  Nonetheless every three\\n  months you  should do a complete backup of your hard disk. \\n  \\n         A number of programs are available to make backing up\\n  easier.  Apple included a very basic full backup application with\\n  System 6.  With the Performas Apple ships a new Apple Backup\\n  utility that can backup the entire disk or just the System folder\\n  onto floppies.  The previously mentioned Norton Utilities for the\\n  Mac and MacTools Deluxe 2.0 include more powerful floppy backup\\n  utilities that incorporate compression and incremental backups.\\n  \\n         Finally if you\\'re lucky enough to have a Tape Drive, network\\n  server, or removable media device to use for backups, you should\\n  check out the more powerful payware utilities Redux ($49 street,\\n  doesn\\'t support tape drives) and Diskfit Pro ($74 street).  There\\n  are NO freely available backup utilities other than the old HD\\n  Backup from System 6.  \\n\\n\\n DISK DEFRAGMENTATION  (4.9)\\n\\n      As disks fill up it gets harder and harder to find enough free\\n  space in the same place to write large files.  Therefore the\\n  operating system will often split larger files into pieces to be\\n  stored in different places on your hard disk.  As files become more\\n  and more fragmented performance can degrade.  There are several\\n  ways to defragment a hard disk.\\n  \\n         The most tedious but cheapest method is to backup all your\\n  files, erase the hard disk (and you might as well reformat while\\n  you\\'re at it.  See question 4.10.), and restore all the files.\\n   \\n         A number of payware utilities including Norton Utilities for\\n  the Mac and Mac Tools Deluxe can defragment a disk in place, i.e.\\n  without erasing it.  Although the ads for all these products brag\\n  about their safety, once you\\'ve bought the software and opened the\\n  shrink-wrap they all warn you to back up your disk before\\n  defragmenting it in case something does go wrong.  There are NO\\n  freeware or shareware disk defragmenters so please don\\'t annoy the\\n  net by asking for one. \\n\\n\\n REFORMAT YOUR HARD DISK  (4.10)\\n\\n      Just as a floppy disk needs to be initialized before use, so a\\n  hard disk must be formatted before it can hold data.  You don\\'t\\n  need to reformat every three months; but when your system is\\n  crashing no matter what you try, reformatting is the ultimate means\\n  of wiping the slate clean.  Reformatting your hard disk may even\\n  gain you a few extra megabytes of space.  Not all hard disks are\\n  created equal.  Some can hold more data than others.  To facilitate\\n  mass production and advertising without a lot of asterisks (* 81.3\\n  megabytes is the average formatted capacity.  Your mileage may\\n  vary.)  Apple often formats drives to the lowest common denominator\\n  of drive capacity.  When you reformat there\\'s no reason at all not\\n  to reclaim whatever unused space Apple\\'s left on your disk.\\n     \\n         Unlike floppies hard disks need a special program to\\n  initialize them. Most hard disks come with formatting software. \\n  Apple\\'s disks and System software ship with HD SC setup, a minimal\\n  disk formatter which will format Apple brand hard drives ONLY. \\n  Most other manufacturers ship appropriate formatting software with\\n  their hard drives.  Normally this will be all you need to reformat\\n  your hard disk.\\n  \\n         A number of general-purpose formatters are also available\\n  which go beyond the bundled software to include features like\\n  encryption, password protection, multiple partitioning, faster disk\\n  access, System 7 compatibility, and even compression.  Two of the\\n  best are the payware Drive7 and Hard Disk Toolkit Personal Edition\\n  ($49 street for either).  While there are one or two freeware\\n  formatters available, none are likely to be superior to the ones\\n  bundled with your hard disk. \\n  \\n         PowerBook users should be sure to turn off Sleep and\\n  processor cycling before reformatting their hard drives no matter\\n  what software they use.  Otherwise disk corruption, crashes, and\\n  data losses are a very good possibility.\\n  \\n\\n\\n  Elliotte Rusty Harold         Department of Mathematics\\n  elharo@shiva.njit.edu         New Jersey Institute of Technology\\n  erh0362@tesla.njit.edu        Newark, NJ 07102\\n\\n' => comp.windows.x \n",

      "'From: ldo@waikato.ac.nz (Lawrence D\\'Oliveiro, Waikato University)\\nSubject: QuickTime performance (was Re: Rumours about 3DO ???)\\nOrganization: University of Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand\\nLines: 67\\n\\nOK, with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with QuickTime,\\nthe effects of scaling and so on, I thought I\\'d do some more tests.\\n\\nFirst of all, I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than\\nrealistic. The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a\\nversion of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).\\nI decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results\\n(for better or for worse).\\n\\nI pulled out a copy of \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" that I had recorded off TV\\na while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there\\'s a sequence where\\nthe Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized\\na portion of about 30 seconds\\' duration, zooming in on the rotating space\\nstation. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between\\nframes. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only\\n5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.\\n\\nI captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot\\ncard in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then\\nimported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,\\nkeeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled\\nto 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default\\n\"2.00\" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten\\nframes.\\n\\nI then ran the 320*240 movie through the same \"Raw Speed Test\" program I used\\nfor the results I\\'d been reporting earlier.\\n\\nResult: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.\\n\\nThat\\'s right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short\\ntest movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard\\ndisk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate\\nwas only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk\\n(also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.\\n\\nI modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional\\nscaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240\\nsize. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who\\nobserved poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in\\naction, not 1.5. I\\'d try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don\\'t think it\\'s\\nentirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...\\n\\nUnscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.\\n\\nThe other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with\\n\"preferred\" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played\\nfrom within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime\\'s normal synchronized playback).\\nA preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn\\'t work too well: the playback was\\nvery jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with\\nease. I can\\'t believe that QuickTime\\'s synchronization code would add this\\nmuch overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system\\'s task\\nswitching.\\n\\nA preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn\\'t see\\nany evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight\\nstutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.\\n\\nI guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the\\nkey frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also\\nimprove the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance\\neven more...\\n\\nLawrence D\\'Oliveiro                       fone: +64-7-856-2889\\nComputer Services Dept                     fax: +64-7-838-4066\\nUniversity of Waikato            electric mail: ldo@waikato.ac.nz\\nHamilton, New Zealand    37^ 47\\' 26\" S, 175^ 19\\' 7\" E, GMT+12:00\\n' => comp.graphics \n",

But, so the reasoning continues, this energy \\n      is released below a lot of matter, so the radiation becomes\\n      thermalized and you expect to see roughly a blackbody spectrum.\\n      The observed spectra are strongly non-thermal, so this model must\\n      be wrong.\"\\nAs so often, the fault lies with the imagination of the person who\\nwas trying to prove the model wrong rather than with the model. It\\nmay be that the initial energy release is not seen as a gamma-ray\\nburst, but the \\'fireball\\' of energy and matter that is created\\nmay spew out a relativistic flow. When this slams into the surrounding \\nmedium, a strong flux of non-thermal gamma rays results, which may\\ncarry off a substantial fraction of the initial total energy. All\\nthis is not my idea: it is in a series of papers by Martin Rees,\\nPeter Meszaros (sorry for the missing accents:-) and co-workers.\\nIt is certainly not a complete model, but it may well be the best one\\naround (summing over all proposed distance scales). An alternative\\nproposal for what creates the initial fireball, by the way, is the \\nso-called \\'failed supernovae\\' scenario by Stan Woosley, in which\\na very massive star at the end of its life collapses to a black\\nhole. If the stellar core was rotating, part of the infalling matter\\nwill be temporarily halted because it is supported by centrifugal\\nforce, and form a very dense neutron torus that accretes onto the\\nblack hole. This beast may spew out a jet along the rotation axis,\\nwhich again constitutes relativistic flow. The rate of such\\nevents may be much higher than that of neutron star mergers,\\nbut the flux may be more strongly beamed, so that the net rate\\nof bursts observed on Earth stays the same between the two\\nscenarios, but the energy released per event can be a lot less\\nin the failed supernova scenario.\\n\\nOn another note: I do believe that the distance scale must \\nultimately be resolved via some classical astronomical method\\nsuch as finding counterparts to the bursts at other wavelengths,\\nor finding a definitive signature of some known class of\\nobjects in the distribution of positions and fluxes. Theorists\\nhave historically not been too successfull in finding the\\ndistance of any object by proving that there is only one\\npossible way in which the object can work, and therefore\\nit *must* be so-and-so.\\n\\nRalph Wijers\\n\\n' => sci.space \n",

On\\nJn. 1, 1992, the prison population was 709,587. Projections\\nshow a continued increase in the number of inmates, with an\\nexpected prison population of 811,253 in 1994.\\n   The conditions which this burgeoning prison population has\\ncreated for corrections officers is partially reflected in the\\nnumber of assaults by inmates against staff.  Assaults against\\nstaff increased dramatically between 1987 and 1989, and remain\\nhigh.  In 1987, there were 808 assaults by inmates against staff,\\ncompared to 9,961 such assaults in 1991.\\n   The increased number of inmates has brought on the dangerous\\ncombination of overcrowding and understaffing.  For example in Ohio\\nofficer-to-inmate ratio is 1 to 8.4 -- the second worst ratio in\\nthe nation. The national average is 1 to 5.3.  Other health and\\nsafety issues facing corrections officers include AIDS, Hepatitis\\nB, tuberculosis, stress, and chemical hazards.\\n   AFSCME has more than 50,000 members who work in the nation\\'s\\nfederal, state and local correctional facilities.\\n   Correction officers are not alone in performing their jobs under\\nlife-threatening conditions.  Every year, 10,000 American workers\\ndie from job-related injuries, and tens of thousands more die from\\noccupational disease.  Public employees do some of the nation\\'s\\nmost dangerous jobs. Perilous occupations include:\\n\\n   -- Highway Workers - Highway workers are often injured and\\n      frequently killed by moving traffic because work zones are\\n      not barricaded or don\\'t have proper lighting.\\n   -- Health Care Workers - Hospitals have the highest number of\\n      job-related injuries and illnesses of any private sector\\n      employer and nursing homes ranked fifth.  There were more\\n      than 325,000 job-related illnesses and injuries in private\\n      sector hospitals in 1991, up almost 10 percent over the\\n      previous year.  It is generally believed that health care\\n      workers employed at public sector hospitals and nursing homes\\n      have a significantly higher rate of injuries and illnesses\\n      than do their private sector counterparts.  Health and safety\\n      issues facing health care workers include exposure to\\n      tuberculosis and the HIV virus, back injuries, and high\\n      levels of stress.\\n   -- Social Workers - Social workers who work in mental health\\n      institutions are often the victims of assaults and,\\n      sometimes, fatal attacks.  For instance, last October, a man\\n      carrying a semiautomatic handgun walked into the Schuyler\\n      County Social Services Building in Watkins Glenn, N.Y.\\n      and fatally shot social services workers, before turning the\\n      gun on himself.  There are two basic problems.  First is a\\n      growing lack of support services for people who don\\'t have\\n      the help they need.  Because workers are overworked, some\\n      clients are not given the adequate amount of counselling.\\n      Such conditions may cause clients to become more frustrated.\\n      The \"quality\" of the clients is also becoming more violent,\\n      as more are moved out of the institutions.\\n\\n   Nearly 2 million workers have been killed by workplace hazards\\nsince OSHA was passed.  Moreover, as AFSCME President Gerald W.\\nMcEntee explains, OSHA does not provide workplace safety\\nprotections for public employees.\\n   \"More than 1,600 public employees are killed each year on the\\njob, yet 27 states still provide no federally-approved OSHA\\ncoverage for public employees,\" said McEntee.  \"This, despite the\\nfact that public employees -- highway workers, health care workers,\\ncorrections officers, to name but a few -- do some of the most\\ndangerous work in our society.  This year we are fighting for\\npassage of OSHA reform legislation to give all workers greater\\nrights and protections, and finally guarantee all public employees\\nsafe workplaces.  We need the public support to be successful.\"\\n   Government workers suffer 25 percent more injuries than private\\nsector workers, and these injuries are almost 75 percent more\\nsevere.\\n   Public employees were exempted from OSHA when the law was passed\\nin 1970 and today, public employees in more than half the states\\nhave no OSHA coverage.\\n -30-\\n--\\nCanada Remote Systems - Toronto, Ontario\\n416-629-7000/629-7044\\n' => talk.politics.misc \n",

I would appreciate any comments about this and other\\n'new' technology for hearing aids.\\n\\nThe ReSound system was developed on the basis of some research at AT&T and\\nappears to take a different approach from other aids. It appears to me that\\na new 'programmable' aid like the Widex just uses a more flexible (and\\nprogrammable) version of the classical approach of amplifying some parts of\\nthe spectrum more than others and adding some compression to try and help\\nout in 'noisy' situations.\\n\\nThe major difference in the ReSound approach is that it divides the\\nspectrum into low and high frequencies (splitting point is programmable),\\napparently based on the fact that lots of vowel information can be found in\\nthe low frequencies, while the important consonant information\\n(unfortunately for me) is in the high frequencies. The two bands then are\\ntreated with different compression schemes which are programable. They have\\nalso developed a new fitting algorythm that builds on what they call\\n'abnormal growth of loudness'.\\n\\nThis latter is interesting and fits my own personal experience, though I\\nthink the phrase is missleading. What appears to be the case is that as you\\nexceed the minimum threshold for a person with hearing loss, the deficit\\nbecomes progresslively less compared to normals and by the time you reach\\nthe 'too loud' point the sensitivity curves appear to converge.  This means\\nthat if you just boost all sound levels, you are overloading at the high\\nend for people with hearing losses. Hence what you want is progressively\\nless amplification as the signal get closer to the maximum tolerable point.\\nYou want to boost low volume sounds more than high and do so potentially\\ndifferently for the low and high frequency parts of the spectrum (specially\\nfor someone like me who is relatively normal up to 1000 cps and then falls\\noff a cliff).\\n\\nAids with simple compressors don't descriminate between energy in the low\\nand high frequencies and can therefor 'compress' useful high frequency\\ninformation because of high volume of low frequency components.\\nParticularly impressive was the ReSound performance with whispered speech\\nand in simulated restaurant noise situations. \\n\\n-Rich Haller <rhaller@ns.uoregon.edu>   University of Oregon, Eugene, OR,\\nUSA\\n\" => alt.atheism \n",

Being me, of course, I\\nused equivalent averages to work out how many runs a player was worth,\\nand I calculated both rate of performance (fielding equivalent\\naverage) and total performance (fielding equivalent runs). But I\\ncompared, not to the average player, but the replacement player, and\\nhere\\'s why: because the positional adjustment comes built in to the\\nsystem. In the AL of 1992, the average SS is 32.9 runs above\\nreplacement (RAR); cf, 31.6; 2B, 28.8; 3B, 26.3; LF, 26.0; RF, 24.6;\\n1B, 16.9. We may quibble with the exact numbers, but the order looks\\nsubstantially right.\\n\\nIn the equivalent average, I have always set league average to .235. I\\nhad decided in hitting that the replacement level batter has an eqa of\\n.180; the name of that replacement level hitter, often as not, is\\n\"Billy Ripken\". I decided to let the replacement level fielder be the\\nsame distance from .235 as .180, but in the opposite direction as I\\nhave set it up; that makes for an eqa of .280. (Yes, I can add. Runs\\nare proportional to eqa squared; the difference between 180 squared\\nand 235 squared equals the difference to 279 squared, and I rounded\\noff for simplicity). An all-replacement fielding team would have:\\nRandy Milligan at first (.282), Willie Randolph (.269) at second, Leo\\nGomez (.279) at third, Walt Weiss (.269) at short, Kevin Bass (.271)\\nin left, HoJo (.257) in center, and Eric Anthony (.277) in right. Ugh.\\n\\nSo, the total number of RAR for a player is the sum of his batting and\\nfielding RAR. I can rate them by total RAR, or RAR per some number of\\nbatting outs, like 400. An average player has a total RAR of about 55,\\n30 batting, 25 fielding.\\n\\nTotal RAR (bat/field)\\n\\n1. Bonds      152 (124/28)  Ventura    124 (66/58)\\n2.

If a patient decides to become pregnant, she discontinues the \\ninjections.\\n\\nAs with any such products, FDA advises patients to discuss the benefits and \\nrisks of Depo Provera with their doctor or other health care professional \\nbefore making a decision to use it.\\n\\nDepo Provera\\'s effectiveness as a contraceptive was established in extensive \\nstudies by the manufacturer, the World Health Organization and health agencies \\nin other countries. U.S. clinical trials, begun in 1963, also found Depo \\nProvera effective as an injectable contraceptive.\\n\\nThe most common side effects are menstrual irregularities and weight gain. In \\naddition, some patients may experience headache, nervousness, abdominal pain, \\ndizziness, weakness or fatigue. The drug should not be used in women who have \\nacute liver disease, unexplained vaginal bleeding, breast cancer or blood \\nclots in the legs, lungs or eyes.\\n\\nThe labeling advises doctors to rule out pregnancy before prescribing the \\ndrug, due to concerns about low birth weight in babies exposed to the drug. \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\nRecent data have also demonstrated that long-term use may contribute to \\nosteoporosis.

[NASDAQ: REGN] have discovered that \\ncertain naturally occurring substances known as neurotrophic factors can \\nprevent the degeneration of light-sensing cells in the retina of the eye. The \\ndegeneration of these cells, known as photoreceptors, is a major cause of \\nvisual impairment \\n     This research, published to in the December issue of the Proceedings of \\nthe National Academy of Science (PNAS), holds promise for people who may lose \\ntheir sight due to progressive retinal degeneration -- currently, no drug \\ntreatment for retinal degeneration exists. It is estimated that 2.5 million \\nAmericans have severe vision loss due to age-related macular degeneration and \\n100,000 Americans are affected by retinitis pigmentosus, a hereditary disease \\nthat causes blindness. In addition, each year more than 15,000 people undergo \\nsurgical procedures to repair retinal detachments and other retinal traumas. \\n     The research was funded in part by the RP (Retinitis Pigmentosa) \\nFoundation Fighting Blindness, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and the National Eye \\nInstitute. It was conducted by Drs. Matthew M. LaVail, Kazuhiko Unoki, Douglas \\nYasurnura, Michael T. Matthes and Roy H. Steinberg at UCSF, arld Dr. C;eorge \\nYancoooulos, Regeneron\\'s Vice President for Discovery. Regeneron holds an \\nexclusive license for this research from UCSF.\\n     In the research described in the PNAS , a light-damage model was used to \\nassess the survival-promoting activity of a number of naturally occurring \\nsubstances. Experimental rats were exposed to constant light for one week. \\nEyes that had not been treated with an effective factor lost most of their \\nphotoreceptor cells -- the rods and cones of the retina -- after light \\nexposure. Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Ciliary Neurotrophic \\nFactor (CNTF) were particularly effective in this model without causing \\nunwanted side effects; other factors such as Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and \\nInsulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1) were not effective in these experiments. \\n     Discussing the research, Dr. Jesse M. Cedarbaum, Regeneron\\'s Director of \\nClinical Research, said, \"BDNF\\'s ability to rescue neurons in the retina that \\nhave been damaged by light exposure may hold promise for the treatment of age-\\nrelated macular degeneration, one of the leading causes of vision impairment, \\nand for retinal detachment. Following detachment, permanent vision loss may \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\nresult frorn the death of detached retinal cells. It is possible that BDNF \\ncould play a role in rescuing those cells once the retina has been reattached \\nsurgically.\" \\n     \"Retinitis pigmentosa is a slowly progressing disease that causes the \\nretina to degenerate over a period of years or even decades. Vision decreases \\nto a small tunnel of sight and can result in total blindness. It is our hope \\nthat research on growth factors will provide a means to slow the progression \\nand preserve useful vision throughout life,\" stated Jeanette S. Felix, Ph.D., \\nDirector of Science for the RP Foundation Fighting Blindness. \\n     In addition to the work described , Regeneron is developing BDNF in \\nconjunction with Aingen Inc. [NASDAQ:AMGN] as a possible treatment for \\nperipheral neuropathies associated with diabetes and cancer chemotherapy, \\nmotor neuron diseases, Parkinson\\'s disease, and Alzheimer\\'s disease. By \\nitself, Regeneron is testing CNTF in patients with arnyotrophic lateral \\nsclerosis (commonly known as Lou Gehrig\\'s disease). \\n     Regeneron Pharlnaceuticals, Inc., based in Tarrytown, New York, is a \\nleader in the discovery and development of biotechnology-based compounds for \\nthe treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, peripheral neuropathies and nerve \\ninjuries, which affect more than seven million Americans. Drs. LaVail and \\nSteinberg of UCSF are consultants to Regeneron.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 19\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\n                 Affluent Diet Increases Risk Of Heart Disease\\n\\n                          Research Resources Reporter\\n                           written by Mary Weideman\\n                                 Nov/Dec 1992\\n                         National Institutes of Health\\n\\n\\n     High-fat, high-calorie diets rapidly increase risk factors for coronary \\nheart disease in native populations of developing countries that have \\ntraditionally consumed diets low in fat.  These findings, according to \\ninvestigators at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland, have \\nserious implications for public health in both industrialized and developing \\ncountries. \\n     \"This study demonstrates why we can develop coronary heart disease and \\nhave higher blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels.  It shows also the \\nimportance of diet and particularly the potential of the diet to increase body \\nweight, thereby leading to a whole host of other health problems in developing \\ncountries and affluent nations as well,\" explains principal investigator Dr. \\nWilliam E. Connor, head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid \\nmetabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University. \\n     Over the past 25 years Dr. Connor and his team have characterized the \\nfood and nutrient intakes of the Tara humara Indians in Mexico, while \\nsimultaneously documenting various aspects of Tarahumara lipid metabolism.  \\nThese native Mexicans number approximately 50,000 and reside in the Sierra \\nMadre Occidental Mountains in the state of Chihuahua.  The Tarahumaras have \\ncoupled an agrarian diet to endurance racing.  Probably as a result, coronary \\nheart disease, which is so prevalent in Western industrialized nations, is \\nvirtually non existent in their culture.  Loosely translated, the name \\nTarahumara means \"fleet of foot,\" reflecting a tribal passion for betting on \\n\"kickball\" races, in which participants run distances of 100 miles or more \\nwhile kicking a machete-carved wooden ball.\\n     The typical Tarahumara diet consists primarily of pinto beans, tortillas, \\nand pinole, a drink made of ground roasted corn mixed with cold water, \\ntogether with squash and gath ered fruits and vegetables.  The Tara humaras \\nalso eat small amounts of game, fish, and eggs.  Their food contains \\napproximately 12 percent of total calories as fat of which the majority (69 \\npercent) is of vegetable origin.  Dietician Martha McMurry, a coinvestigator \\nin the study, describes their diet as simple and very rich in nutrients while \\nlow in cholesterol and fat.\\n     The Tarahumaras have average plasma cholesterol levels of 121 mg/ dL, \\nlow-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels of 72 mg/dl, and high-density \\nlipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels of 32 to 42 mg/dl.  All of those values \\nare in the good, low-risk range, according to the researchers.  Elevated \\ncholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels are considered risk factors for heart \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 20\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\ndisease.  HDL-cholesterol is considered beneficial.  In previous studies the \\nTarahumaras had been found to be at low risk for cardiac disease, although \\nable to respond to high-cholesterol diets with elevations in total and LDL-\\ncholesterol. \\n     Clinical Research Center dietitian McMurry and coinvestigator Maria \\nTeresa Cerqueira established a metabolic unit in a Jesuit mission school \\nbuilding near a community hospital in the small village of Sisoguichi.  Food \\nwas weighed, cooked, and fed to the study participants under the \\ninvestigators\\' direct supervision, ensuring that subjects ate only food \\nstipulated by the research protocol.  Fasting blood was drawn twice weekly, \\nand plasma samples were frozen and shipped to Dr. Connors laboratory for \\ncholesterol, triglyceride, and lipoprotein analyses.  Regular measurements \\nincluded participant body weight, height, and triceps skin fold thickness.  \\nThirteen Tarahumaras, five women and eight men, including one adolescent, were \\nfed their native diet for 1 week, followed by 5 weeks of an \"affluent\" diet. \\n     \"In this study we went up to a concentration of dietary fat that was 40 \\npercent of total calories.  This is the prototype of the holiday diet that \\nmany Americans consume a diet high in fat, sugar, and cholesterol, low in \\nfiber,\" elaborates Dr. Conners. Such dietary characteristics are reflected in \\nthe cholesterol-saturation index, or CSI, recently devised research dietitian \\nSonja Conner working with Dr. Connor.  \"The CSI is a single number that \\nincorporates both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturated fat in \\nthe diet.  CSI indicates the diet\\'s potential to elevate the cholesterol \\nlevel, particularly the LDL,\" Dr. Connor explains.  The Tarahumaran diet \\naverages a very low CSI of 20; Dr. Connor\\'s \"affluent\" diet used in the study \\nranks a CSI of 149. \\n     The experimental design of this study reflects the importance of \\nestablishing baseline plasma lipid levels, typical of the native diet, before \\nexposing subjects to the experimental diet.  The standard curve relating \\ndietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrates a leveling off, or \\nplateau, for consumption of large amounts of fat.  Changes in dietary fat \\nand/or cholesterol in this range have little effect on plasma levels.  \"You \\nmust have the baseline diet almost free of the variables you are going to put \\ninto the experimental diet.  The Framingham study, for example, did not \\ndiscriminate on the basis of diet between individuals who got heart disease \\nbecause the diet was already high in fat.  All subjects were already eating on \\na plateau,\" Dr. Connor says. \\n     After 5 weeks of consuming the \"affluent\" diet, the subjects\\' mean plasma \\ncholesterol levels had in creased by 31 percent, primarily in the LDL \\nfraction, which rose 39 percent.  HDL-cholesterol increased by 31 per cent, \\nand LDL to HDL ratios changed therefore very little.  Plasma triglyceride \\nlevels increased by 18 percent, and subjects averaged an 8-pound gain in \\nweight.  According to Dr. Connor, lipid changes occurred surprisingly soon, \\nyielding nearly the same results after 7 days of affluent diet as after 35 \\ndays. \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 21\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\n     The increase in HDL carries broad dietary implications for industrialized \\nnations.  \"We think HDL-cholesterol increased because we increased the amount \\nof dietary fat over the fat content used in the previous Tarahumara metabolic \\nstudy.  In that study we saw no change in HDL levels after raising the dietary \\ncholesterol but keeping the fat relatively consistent with native consumption.  \\nIn the present study we increased fat intake to 40 percent of the total \\ncalories.  We reached the conclusion in the Tarahumara study that HDL reflects \\nthe amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietary \\ncholesterol.  HDL must increase to help metabolize the fat, and it increased \\nquite a bit in this study,\" Dr. Connor explains.\\n     Low HDL in the Tarahumarans is not typically an important predictor of \\ncoronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amounts of \\nfat or cholesterol.  HDL remains an important predictor to Americans because \\nof their usual high fat intake. \\n     Dr. Connor recommends a diet for Americans that contains less than 20 \\npercent of total calories as fat, less than 100 mg of cholesterol, and a CSI \\naround 20, varying in accordance with caloric needs.  Such a diet is low in \\nmeat and dairy fat, high in fiber.  Dr. Connor also comments on recent \\nsuggestions that Americans adopt a \"Mediterranean-style\" diet.  \"The original \\nMediterranean diet, in its pristine state, consisted of a very low intake of \\nfat and very few animal and dairy products.  We are already eating a lot of \\nmeat and dairy products.  Simply to continue that pattern while switching to \\nolive oil is not going to help the situation.\" \\n     The World Health Organization (WHO) is focusing much attention on the \\nemergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations and societies \\nundergoing technological development.  Dr. Connor says that coronary heart \\ndisease starts with a given society\\'s elite, who typically eat a different \\ndiet than the average citizen.  \"If the pattern of afluence increases, the \\nentire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease, \\nwhich places a termendous health care burden on a society.  WHO would like the \\ndeveloping countries to prevent coronary heart disease, so they can \\nconcentrate on other aspects of their economic development and on public \\nhealth measures to improve general well-being, rather than paying for \\nunnecessary, expensive medical technology,\" Dr. Connors says.\\n     \"The overall implication of this study is that humans can readily move \\ntheir plasma lipids and lipoprotein values into a high-risk range within a \\nvery short time by an affluent, excessive diet.  The present rate of coronary \\nheart disease in the United States is 30 percent less than it was 20 years \\nago, so a lot has been accomplished.  We are changing rapidly,\" he concludes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 22\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\n\\n\\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\\n                             General Announcments\\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\\n\\n        Publications for Health Professionals Available from NCI (1/93)\\n\\nUnless otherwise noted, the following materials are provided free of charge by \\ncalling the NCI\\'s Publication Ordering Service, 1-800-4-CANCER.

Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)\\n  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats\\n  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert\\n  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.\\n  Tgif\\'s sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu\\n  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)\\n\\nd. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).\\n  This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all\\n  your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.\\n\\ne.

This was\\n  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working\\n  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL\\n  or would be willing to buy it.  It\\'s a few thousand dollars (American) I\\n  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general\\n  purpose packages I\\'ve heard of, besides what TerraMar has.\\n  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I\\'m not sure how general purpose\\n  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I\\n  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh\\n  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image\\n  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I\\'ve\\n  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best\\n  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large\\n  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That\\'s a\\n  freebie if you want it\"\\n\\n  \"My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,\\n  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its\\n  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It\\n  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing\\n  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even\\n  Excel on the Mac if it\\'s not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH\\n  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which\\n  that combination couldn\\'t handle, and the speed and ease of use\\n  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it\\'s mostly astronomical\\n  image processing which I\\'ve been doing. This means image enhancement,\\n  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image\\n  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity\\n  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve\\n  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) \"\\n\\n[ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and\\n for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder .

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)\\n===================================================\\n\\nGRASS\\n-----\\n  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army\\n  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and\\n  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a\\n  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,\\n  although it is reported to have significant image processing\\n  capabilities.\\n\\n  Feature Descriptions\\n\\n  I use GRASS  because it\\'s public domain and can be obtained through the\\n  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source\\n  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass\\n  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using\\n  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who\\n  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very\\n  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software.\" A first review  of\\n  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel\\n  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose\\n  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in\\n  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the\\n  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric\\n  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective\\n  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus\\n  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them\\n  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh\\n  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for\\n  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC\\n  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,\\n  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster\\n  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it\\n  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented\\n  in raster (grid-cell) form.\\n\\n  Availability\\n\\n  CERL\\'s Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:\\n  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).\\n\\n  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to\\n  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  This location will be the new \"canonical\" source for GRASS software, as\\n  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.\\n  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and\\n  \"tar\" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John\\n  Parks\\' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,\\n  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review\\n  it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently\\n  maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be\\n  directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu\\n\\n  Support\\n\\n  Listserv mailing lists:\\n\\n  grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level\\n  questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send\\n  subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level\\n  questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation\\n  of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to\\n  grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of\\n  the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in\\n  Champaign, IL).

Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager\\n  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a\\n  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.\\n\\n  Feature Description\\n\\n  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.\\n  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a\\n  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).\\n  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.

Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages\\n  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band\\n  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.\\n\\n  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle\\n  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available\\n  for GIS applications.\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)\\n  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software\\n  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.\\n\\nPCI\\n---\\n  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes\\n  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of\\n  remote sensing data in eight or ten different \"industry standard\"\\n  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I\\n  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix\\n  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly\\n  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.\\n\\n  The \"PCI software\" consists of several classes/groups/packages of\\n  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common \"PCI\\n  database\" disk file.  The \"Tape I/O\" package is a set of utility\\n  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape\\n  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the \"PCI database\" file;\\n  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can\\n  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several\\n  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap\\n  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type\\n  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically\\n  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and\\n  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.\\n  \"multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5\"), and\\n  God only knows what all else -- there\\'s a LOT.  I don\\'t have and don\\'t\\n  use these, so can\\'t say much about them; you only buy the packages your\\n  particular application/interest calls for.\\n\\n  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight \"parameters,\" read from\\n  a common \"parameter file\" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your \"default\\n  directory.\"  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same\\n  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting\\n  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a\\n  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to\\n  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,\\n  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also\\n  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There\\'s\\n  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled\\n  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI\\n  data structures (database file, parameter file).\\n\\n  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but\\n  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the\\n  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle\\n  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a\\n  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the\\n  Macintosh calls \"raw\") data from tape, in a number of different\\n  \"interleave\" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the\\n  graphic-arts industry\\'s \"CT2T\" format, would probably (I haven\\'t tried)\\n  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT\\n  YOU\\'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start\\n  over.  It\\'s worth noting that the PCI \"database\" file is designed to\\n  contain not only \"raster\" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map\\n  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of\\n  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often\\n  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,\\n  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this\\n  can go into the PCI \"database\").\\n\\n  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX\\n  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific\\n  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to\\n  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would\\n  display directly from a PCI \"database\" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus\\n  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be \"overkill\"\\n  in your case; it seems designed for the very \"high end\"\\n  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn\\'t suffice\\n  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It\\'s\\n  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which\\n  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe\\n  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these\\n  areas.\\n\\nSPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)\\n--------------------------------\\n  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis\\n  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed\\n  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels\\n  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since\\n  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging\\n  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.\\n\\n  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and\\n  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).\\n  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement\\n  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.\\n\\n  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may\\n  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame\\n  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you\\'re interested.  PCW requires X\\n  for display.\\n\\nMAP II\\n------\\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.\\n\\nCLRview\\n-------\\n  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit\\n  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.\\n\\n  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the\\n  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.

The garage is Unheated.  \\nThey were left in their places that they needed to be.  One in the riding\\nlawnmower (what a lux) and one in each motorcycle.  The battery in the \\nriding lawnmower was about 3-4 years old, and one of the cycle batteries \\nwas new, and one was around 5 years old.  Upon spring time, I discovered\\nthat all of the batteries were dead, and needed to be recharged.  They all\\nworked properly, except for the older ones, and they had to be replaced \\nabout halfway through the summer.  (they had originally been stored\\nin the garage, and I think I remember my dad charging them in spring)\\n  Last year, I decided to bring them in to the basement, which has two parts.\\none is dirt and brick, and the other is concrete.  I brought in all three, and\\ndiscovered in the spring, (about 15 days ago) that not only were the batteries\\ndead, but when I put the charger on them, the charger said \"HMMMMMMMM\" and \\nthe amp-meter read around 1,000,000,000  (In other words, it was pinned)\\nthe internal circut tripped, and I went on to the other batteries.  They\\nwere the same.  \\n   Realizing that we still had 2 GIGANTIC sailboat batteries, also lead\\nacid, I decided to put the charger on them.  (these had been sitting for around 1 and a half years, on the brick and dirt part) and noticed that they only\\nneeded a small charge, around 2 hours or so on trickle.  I tested them\\nby using them at the local gas station for giving jump starts, and they\\nworked fine for around 25 of \\'em. \\n  This leads me to believe one of several things.\\n     1) I bought really #$%tty batteries last year. (sorta true)\\n     2) the concrete has something to do with the discharge of the\\n        batteries.\\n     3) There was enough moisture to short out the terminals in the \\n          room where the concrete is, \\n     4) The dirt room was able to absorb the moisture in the air\\n         better than concrete.\\n\\n(BTW, I can almost waterski in the dirt room)  \\n\\n   Any other ideas?\\n    *could be the aliens, anything is possible.*\\n \\n' => talk.politics.mideast \n",

Also I use\\nStacker on the primary drive, HP Newwave (for my wife\\'s use, and she \\nwon\\'t let me get rid of it!), and a product called Infinite Disk from \\nChili Pepper Software for hierarchical storage management of my seldom \\nused offline files.  \\n\\nI plan to upgrade to NT, when it becomes a released product.  I was stongly\\ntempted to become a beta user early on, but I don\\'t have time to mess around\\nwith the hassles of beta software.  I expect to buy it, tear off the \\nshrink wrap, and use it without hassle (I know, unrealistic, but I can\\nhope can\\'t I, after all, I have work to do).\\n\\nThe advice I want concerns the state of NT regarding device drivers, and \\nhardware specific stuff in general.  How smoothly can I expect the \\nupgrade to go?  Can I expect support for all my stuff, or do I\\nstill need to scramble around downloading drivers (PAS?, Orchid?, Colorado?) \\nfrom some bbs, etc.  What steps should I take to ensure the installation\\ngoes smoothly.  Note that I want to nuke dos totally from the system.  I\\'m\\nallergic to command lines!  I plan to run a \"pure\" NT system.  Also, will \\nNT communicate with the workgroups lan?  What about stacker?  I currently \\nhave stacker on the first disk drive.  Without Stacker, and the Infinite \\nDisk product, I will have great difficulty fitting everything I have on the \\nsystem (It\\'s cramped now).\\n\\nI realize Stacker will be incompatible with NT, but will there be an NT \\nversion?  Or will NT support compression a la Dos 6?  I know Infinite Disk\\nwill be incompatible with NT, but will they offer (or does anybody else)\\na comparable product for NT and at what cost?  (perhaps I need to ask \\nChili Pepper that question)  I can live without ID if I have to, but I\\'d\\nrather not.  Will NT run my DOS apps (the teletext board mainly) without\\nDOS on the system?  What do I need to keep around?\\n\\nAny feedback or advice (including \"forget NT\" with good reasons) is much\\nappreciated.  My only significant reason for moving to NT is I need a better\\nmultitasking environment than Windows (among other reasons, WAVE locks up\\nthe machine for hours and hours doing DSP processing on large audio files),\\nand I want better lan support than I now have (Internet access, etc).  Maybe\\nthere are better solutions than NT and if so, I would appreciate hearing \\nabout them (OS/2?  What\\'s it\\'s status these days?)\\n\\nPls respond by email and if there is interest I\\'ll summarize for the net.\\n\\nThanks,\\nNathan Gregory\\np00211@psilink.com\\n\\n' => comp.os.ms-windows.misc \n",

I agree that arrogance is not the result\\nof religion and that God is a far better judge than we are.  I also agree if\\nyou mean to say that arrogance shows up in the form of trying to prove one\\'s\\nsuperior knowledge, rightness, or holiness over another person\\'s beliefs.\\n\\nI need to be careful to understand what you mean here so that I do not fall\\ninto the mistake of misrepresenting your views.  If I fall down in this area\\nI hope you will forgive me.\\n\\nArrogance is not the result of believing one is right or of believing that\\none\\'s God is greater than the god\\'s of others or of believing that one\\'s\\nreligion is better than other religions.  These are all naturally self-implied\\nbeliefs.\\n\\nIt is self-contradictory to say that I believe my current beliefs to be wrong.\\nWere I to find myself in error, my beliefs would naturally change and follow\\nwhat I believe to be right.  Therefore, I must always consider my beliefs\\ncorrect.  That\\'s not arrogance.  That\\'s unavoidable behavior.\\n\\nIt is nonsense to say that I believe another person\\'s god to be greater than\\nmy God.  Were his or her god greater, wouldn\\'t I be obligated to change so\\nthat their god would become my God?  We are naturally obligated to worship\\nthat God which we deem to be the greatest.  Why should we feel obligated to\\nworship a second best god for the sake of feeling humble?\\n\\nArrogance is not necessarily thinking onesself to be better looking or more\\nintelligent or stronger or having more resources than another person.  No\\ndoubt many will have to chew on this one awhile.  Were passive observation\\nof one\\'s superior points arrogance, then God would be most arrogant of all.\\n\\nHumility does not rest in slandering or belittling God\\'s work of creation in\\nour lives.  People often go around trying to be humble saying to one another,\\n\"I\\'m not very smart.  I\\'m poor.  I\\'m not good looking.  I\\'m just a worm in\\nthe ground.  I\\'m such a weak person and although I don\\'t want to sin, I\\nreally cannot help it.\"  Were this person truely humble, he would take a\\ndifferent approach.  \"God, thank you for making me the way you did.  I know\\nthat you never do anything second best.  Yet with all that you have given me,\\nI have been so unthankful.  You\\'ve given me power to resist the devil.  I\\nhave not used it but have indulged myself in doing exactly what you have said\\nnot to do.  I have slandered your creation in my life and have credited myself\\nwith humility for doing so.  Lord, with all you\\'ve given me, I have been\\ncompletely unfaithful and I do not deserve your forgiveness.  And, yet Your\\nlove for me is so boundless that you would give Yourself to die for me to\\nsave me.  As terribly evil as I am, I deserve to go straight to hell, yet it\\npleases you somehow to rescue me from this terrible life I\\'ve led.  Lord,\\nplease forgive me and help me stay on the right track so that I can bring\\nglory to Your Name instead of insult.  Lord I\\'m so sorry for my wrongs.  Please\\nhelp me to change.\"\\n\\n: \\n: I think people take exceptional offense to religious arrogance because\\n: they don\\'t want to be wrong.  If I find someone arrogant, I typically\\n: don\\'t have anything to do with them.\\n\\nFor me, I\\'ve often found it hard to tell the difference.  Often times, the\\nmost humble christian has come across to me as arrogant while the most\\nproud \"worm in the ground\" false humility type person has been found to be\\nmost comfortable company.\\n\\nWhen I\\'m wrong and arrogant about my wrongness, I certainly don\\'t feel like\\nbeing confronted by my wrongness.  Were someone to confront me verbally with\\nmy wrongness, I\\'d be likely to snap at them and examine them head to toe for\\nall their faults and charge them with hypocricy for what they said to me.\\nAt the root, my desire would be to make them shut up so that I can go about\\nliving my life arrogantly as I wish.  However, were someone to confront me\\nsilently by their example, earn my respect, and perhaps mention it to me in\\nhumility in private, I\\'d feel broken down and challenged to seek God for help\\nin changing from the error of my ways.\\n\\nThe hard part is getting to the point to where I can be humble before anyone\\nregardless of their humility or pride--regardless of their hypocricy or\\nsincerity--regardless of whether onlookers will frown down upon me or not.\\nIt isn\\'t easy to take this pain in love with thankfulness for the opportunity\\nto improve in one\\'s ability to serve God.  It\\'s easier to cast aside any hope\\nof reaching true humility and merely hide behind slandering God\\'s creation\\nin our lives instead.\\n\\n: But we should examine ourselves [I hope I typed this back in right]\\n: and why we react to certain situations with such emotions.  For instance,\\n: many of us feel \"justified\" to be insulted by an arrogant person.  As if\\n: we needed a reason to feel insulted.  But after being insulted over and\\n: over again by the words of others, you\\'d think we\\'d either toughen up\\n: or decide not to be insulted, or ignore the insult.  Just because you\\n: can justify feelings of anger or insult or outrage, that doesn\\'t make that\\n: reaction the appropriate one.  It is in this light of self-examination\\n: that we can change our emotional reactions.\\n: \\n\\nSometimes it helps when we can understand and feel the difference between\\nwhat is a true statement of our character and what is a false and slanderous\\nstatement of our character.  The devil is the accuser of the bretheren.  He\\nwould love us to feel hopelessly guilty where we are innocent and feel arrogant\\nand self-righteous where we are indeed wrong.  The devil\\'s aim is to get us\\ninto as much misery as he can.  Just think of the devil as a cruel and merci-\\nless criminal who torments a parent by burning his or her children with\\nhot irons.

The only other things \\nwhich come to mind, since this is a gravity feed fuel system, is this.\\nThe fuel petcock valve is vacuum controlled from the #1 carburator. Let\\nsuppose there is a small hole or bad seal either in the hose itself or the\\nvacuum valve in the fuel petcock. When it is cold, the hole is open enough\\nto open the valve just enough to allow gas to the carbs with the choke on, \\nsince the choke creates more low pressure in the carbs when on to draw gas, \\nand as the engine and surrounding area warm up, the hole seals up. \\n\\nOne way to check fuel flow through the valve would be to pull the side \\npanels off and remove the fuel hose to the carbs. Connect a tube of the \\ncorrect size, preferably clear tubing to observe fuel flow, on the output\\nside of the fuel petcock. Remove the control hose from #1 carburator. Make\\nsure the tank is full. Place the valve in the ON position and apply vacuum \\nto the control hose, preferably with a vacuum device with a gauge, to check \\nfor air leaks. With vacuum applied, fuel should flow freely. To see if there is\\na vent problem, do this with the fuel filler cap open and closed, if it \\nflows a lot faster with the filler cap open, then there may be something in \\nthe vent airway which changes position and depending on the position may clog \\nor partially clog the vent. I have heard of some F2 fuel tanks being replaced \\nto fix this problem. So the things which might be defective are, the control\\nhose from #1 carb, the petcock valve, and possibly the fuel tank vent.\\n\\nNow if all of the above shows no problem of fuel flow when cold, then there \\nis something in the carbs screwed up, but there are so many things to check, \\nI would be typing all day to list them all! \\n\\nHere are a few, with everything back together, apply vacuum to the petcock valve\\nand open the drain holes on the carbs one by one to check fuel flow. Open up the\\nairbox and check for foreign debris or clogged airways on the carbs, there are\\nquite a few on each carb.\\n\\nI hope something is flushed out with all this trouble shooting. If American\\nHonda does not resolve this, get MAD AS HELL and report them to the BBB and\\ncall the Honda Customer Service HOTLINE.

Andrew Byler)\\n>Does anyone now where an English translation of the long recension of\\n>the Acts of the Apostles can be found?\\n\\n1] An english translation of this can be found in:\\n   \"The Acts of the Apostles, translated from the Codex Bezae, with an\\n   introduction on its Lucan Origin and Importance\", J. M. Wilson\\n   (London, 1923).\\n\\n2] Another work that might be useful is:\\n   \"The Acts of the Apostles, a Critical Edition with Introduction and\\n   Notes on Selected Passages\", Albert C. Clark (Oxford, 1933;\\n   reprinted 1970).\\n\\n(This is an edition of text of Acts that makes the assumption that the\\ntext in Codex Bezae is the more authentic.  I don\\'t know if it\\nactually contains an english translation or not.)\\n\\n3] Another useful that discusses many of the variants in detail is:\\n   \"The Theological Tendency of the Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis in\\n   Acts\", Eldon J Epp (Cambridge, 1966).\\n\\n4] The most recent reference I found was an edition in French from the\\nearly \\'80s.  (I can supply the reference if anyone\\'s interested.)\\n\\n5] Now, many of the works are going to be difficult to find.  So if\\nyou\\'re interested in examining the differences in the long recension\\nan excellent (and easily obtainable) discussion can be found in:\\n   \"A Textual Commentary on the Greek NT\", Bruce Metzger (United Bible\\n   Society, 1971).\\n\\nMetzger\\'s book serves as a companion volume to the UBS 3rd edition of\\nthe Greek NT.  It contains a discussion on the reasoning that went\\nbehind the decisions on each of the 1440 variant readings included in\\nthe UBS3.  Furthermore, notes on an addition 600 readings are\\nincluded in aTCotGNT (the majority of these occur in Acts).\\n\\nIn particular in the introduction to the section on Acts Metzger writes:\\n   \"[An attempt was made] to set before the reader a more or less full\\n   report (with an English translation) of the several additions and\\n   other modifications that are attested by Western witnesses ...\\n   Since many of these have no corresponding apparatus in the\\n   text-volume, care was taken to supply an adequate conspectus of the\\n   evidence that supports the divergent readings.\" (p 272).\\n\\n>I understand that one of the early codexes, Vaticanus and Siniaticus has\\n>this version of Acts.  It would be interesting to know what the\\n>differences are between the long and the short forms.\\n\\n6] Most of the copies of the text of Acts that we have (including the\\nones in Vaticanus and Siniaticus) adher pretty closely to the shorter\\n(or Alexandrian) version.  The longer version to which you refer is\\nusually called the \"Western\" version and its main witness is the Codex\\nBezae (althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources).\\n\\n7] As far as size, the difference is that in Clark\\'s edition\\n(mentioned above) the book of Acts contains 19,983 words whereas the\\ntext edited by Westcott and Hort (a typical Alexandrian text) contains\\n18,401 words; i.e. a difference of about 8-1/2%.\\n\\n8] To answer the obvious questions, no, there are no major revelations\\nin the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text.  The main\\ndifference seems to \"expansion\" of detail in the Western text (or, if\\nyou prefer \"contractions\" in the Alexandrian).  The Western text seems\\nto be given to more detail.  There are some interesting specific\\ncases, but this probably not the place to go into it in detail.\\n\\n9] The discussion over the years as to which of these versions is the\\nmore authentic has been hot and heavy.  If there is anything\\napproaching a modern consensus it is (i) that neither text represents\\npurely the \"authentic\" version, (ii) each variant reading has to be\\nexamined on its own merits however, (iii) the variant in the\\nAlexandrian text is the \"better\" more often than not.\\n\\nN\\n' => alt.atheism \n",

The \\nentire Turkish population of Armenia (which Armenians called Tartars) \\nconstituted at least about 40% of the total population of Armenia \\nwas deliberately exterminated.
